0,What do you think of the Apple Vision Pro?,"Just today ‚Äî the day of release ‚Äî I was one of the first members of the public to experience the Apple Vision Pro demo.
Purely by accident.
Whatever you know or think you know about this ‚Ä¶ get ready to be run over.
I came into the Apple store without an appointment with an iPad that wouldn‚Äôt charge. There were no plans to be impressed by anything. I left with a glimpse into the future.
What am I going to do? I asked the salesman that because I was so excited by what I experienced and realized I could never, ever explain it to anyone.
He smiled.
‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
Have you seen IMAX? Not the fakey digital knockoff, but the original gigapixel version on 70mm film? Well, there was actually a more ambitious predecessor called OMNIMAX that was shown only in special spherical theaters. Though it completely filled your entire vision field, it didn‚Äôt work perfectly. There was all kinds of distortion from the mismatch of the screen‚Äôs and the camera lenses‚Äô curvatures, plus the imperfections of projected film.
Imagine OMNIMAX with digital perfection, 4K resolution, and true 3-D. And without six figures‚Äô worth of projector and screen. Just a headset.
One clip of a baseball game was felt like i was actually on my stomach on the dirt watching home plate. Another shot of a tropical beach looked as if I could step right onto the ground below me. You look down, there‚Äôs the dirt. Look up ‚Äî sky. Just like reality.
This is real, honest, true, no-BS virtual reality.
Really.
But that‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù the razzle and dazzle.
What about everyday utility?
I feel as though no one ever mentioned this, but ‚Ä¶ this could be your computer screen. I love my iPad, and use it for everything that most use a PC for ‚Äî even writing articles and doing taxes. I love the convenience and simplicity of it ‚Äî no mouse or extra gear, always ready to go with no boot-up. But ‚Ä¶ the fact that it‚Äôs handheld makes it too close to my eyes. After years of this, I‚Äôm seeing double. How can I get a screen a little farther away and still have control with just my hands (no pointing device)?
Vision Pro looks like the answer.
The large virtual screen is about 3 feet away (seems like you could just reach right out and touch it), conveniently located right in front of you, and just the size you want. You point with your eyes (yep, it follows that) and ‚Äúclick‚Äù with your fingers ‚Äî wherever they are. You navigate with your eyes and fingers, stretch and zoom. Just like on an iPad, except instead of on glass you do it in virtual space.
At the end, the salesman asked what I thought.
‚ÄúI want it.‚Äù
He smiled.
‚ÄúI know. I want it too.‚Äù"
1,How does Apple Vision Pro work?,"Apple Vision Pro: Unveiling the Myths and Realities
Amidst the ever-changing landscape of technology, Apple's Vision Pro stands as a beacon of innovation, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world. However, separating the myths from the facts surrounding this highly anticipated device is crucial to understanding its true potential and impact on Apple's trajectory.
Myth: The Vision Pro Will Drive Apple's Immediate Success
Despite Tim Cook's enthusiastic portrayal of the Vision Pro as a ""revolutionary device,"" analysts predict a more gradual rise in its revenue contribution. Morgan Stanley estimates that the Vision Pro may reach a maximum of $4 billion in revenue by 2027, a far cry from Apple's current quarterly revenue of $119.58 billion.
The Vision Pro's full potential lies in the distant future, with its mature, mass-market version not expected until 2030 or beyond. This long gestation period raises concerns about its immediate impact on Apple's bottom line, mirroring the challenges faced by Meta's Reality Labs.
Fact: Apple's China Conundrum
Apple's heavy reliance on China, with approximately 20% of its iPhone revenue originating from the country, has become a double-edged sword. While China presents a lucrative market, the growing popularity of domestic Chinese phone brands is eroding Apple's dominance.
In the most recent quarter, Apple's sales in Greater China plummeted by nearly 13%, marking its only region with declining sales. This setback, coupled with Apple's projected revenue decline in the upcoming quarter, highlights the urgency of addressing this challenge.
first gen product. wait for it.üëÜüèª
Fact: Google's Cultural Overhaul
Google's recent earnings call revealed a candid acknowledgment of the need for cultural transformation. President Ruth Porat emphasized the company's focus on ""removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity,"" signaling a shift towards greater efficiency and agility.
This introspection and willingness to address internal issues demonstrate Google's commitment to overcoming its perceived slowness and fostering a more dynamic work environment.
Myth: Digital Advertising's Demise
Contrary to popular belief, the digital advertising industry is not in decline. While certain segments may be experiencing challenges, the overall trend indicates continued growth.
Google's advertising revenue, for instance, grew by 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, despite broader economic uncertainties. This resilience underscores the enduring importance of digital advertising as a revenue stream for tech giants.
Conclusion: Navigating the Tech Labyrinth
In the midst of flux and uncertainty, discerning the truth from the noise in the tech industry is paramount. By examining the myths and facts surrounding Apple's Vision Pro, China's impact on Apple, Google's cultural transformation, and the state of digital advertising, we gain a clearer understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for these tech behemoths.

2,What are your thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro headset?,"* It is stunning.
* It is a technological marvel almost beyond imagination.
* It is the future.
* But is not for everyone. Not for most people. Not for many people. Not, in fact, for almost anyone.
Let me explain:
I have been putting the Vision Pro through its paces for the past 24 hours, and it is clear that it is bringing the future into the present. It is also clear that it is literally an order of magnitude more advanced than any other AR/VR product ever developed.
It is instantly reminiscent of the Apple ][ with VisiCalc, the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, and even the Apple Watch when they were introduced. Each of these broke completely new ground in bringing frontier technology to the masses, redefined our interface with technology, were under-featured, over-priced, and required patience to deal with unfamiliar new interfaces and limited applications.
Just as I was the first person in my entire family to get a computer and an iPhone, and am still the only person in the family with an Apple Watch and iPad, I will clearly be the only one with a Vision Pro for the next year or so. It‚Äôs too new fangled for my father‚Äôs generation, too fiddly and intrusive and inconvenient for my generation, and too expensive for the next generation. But for me and those of my ilk (‚Äútech enthusiasts‚Äù and a very few ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù) who can afford it, the Vision Pro is like taking a jump 5‚Äì10 years into the future.
Until now the prevalent approach to immersive visual computing and gaming has been Virtual Reality, replacing the live image your eyes see with a computer generated image‚Äîeither realistic or not. In recent years, and with the explosion of smartphones that include high resolution cameras, displays, and computing power, there has been an increase in Augmented Reality, overlaying computer generated images to interact with live images, for things like navigation directions and furniture placement. While both MagicLeap and Microsoft with HoloLens have attempted to create AR-based devices, neither has met with much in the way of consumer acceptance, nor even business use cases (other than a military contract for HoloLens).
Whereas the technology involved in Apple‚Äôs previous product launches was generally the best of what was currently available put into a consumer friendly format, the Vision Pro is all that‚Ä¶plus introducing an insane collection of raw technological advances, overlaid (literally) onto a worldview that is fundamentally different from what the incumbent market players have done so far.. With the Vision Pro, Apple has done what it inarguably does better than any other organization on the planet: deliver best of breed hardware and an elegant, cohesive, comprehensive, operating system that integrates with everything else that Apple produces or sells. In this case, Apple is taking Spatial Computing mainstream. There simply is no comparison between the Vision Pro and the earlier MagicLeap and HoloLens offerings.
The apps and demos available at launch are, in many cases, mind-blowing, what James Cameron declared to be ‚Äúa religious experience‚Äù. Watching films in Apple‚Äôs new Immersive Video (180 degree, 8k, 3D) is like nothing you have ever seen. Seeing planes landing and taking off from an airport in realtime 3D gives you a peek into what the future will be, and FaceTiming with multiple people in your own living room is not just a feature, it‚Äôs a whole new application. Unlike the compromises necessary with existing AR attempts, Apple‚Äôs insanely high resolution cameras and displays, combined with its powerful Apple silicon chips, delivers on the promise of true spatial computing in your own real world environment.
But since only a few million people (max!) will use this over the next several years (compared to billions with smartphones), he truly important thing about the Vision Pro has nothing to do with its groundbreaking hardware, and nothing to do with the thousands of ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù iPad apps it can run. Instead, the best analogy for the Vision Pro is‚Ä¶Uber.
Think about what Uber has done over the past decade: they have created an insanely powerful, comprehensive, ubiquitous, seamless, system that will trans..."
3,What is the main purpose of Apple Vision Pro?,"Apple envisions the Vision Pro as a trailblazing entry into a ""new era of spatial computing."" As a standalone wearable computer, its primary aim is to revolutionize various experiences, such as watching TV, working, reliving digital memories, and enabling remote collaborations, especially in apps like FaceTime.
Despite its ambitious goals, the specific 'point' or singular purpose of the Vision Pro is still evolving. At launch, it will offer functionalities like providing a large, portable monitor for Apple laptops and creating a captivating cinematic experience in apps like Disney Plus. However, much like the early days of the Apple Watch, the full potential of the Vision Pro will be shaped by developers and users, who will define the groundbreaking use cases that truly set it apart."
4,What is Apple's Vision Pro?,"The Vision Pro marks Apple's significant entry into a new product category after an eight-year gap. It introduces a revolutionary type of headset that offers unique control capabilities through the wearer's eyes, hands, and voice ‚Äì a key differentiator not found in other headsets. Apple CEO Tim Cook referred to it as the company's first product that you ""look through"" rather than ""look at,"" highlighting its groundbreaking concept of ""spatial computing"" and the addition of a new dimension to the world of powerful personal technology."
5,Do you think the Apple Vision Pro headset will succeed?,"No, this will be Tim Cook's Waterloo and will lead to a change in Apple's CEO. They need a ""right-brained"" leader who can adapt to the AI era.
Jobs invented a money-making tool, and Tim Cook made a lot of money by continuously using it, which made many people think he was strong. But in reality, he's just an operator of the machine. He stole Jobs' credit.
So, in order to prove himself and cover up his mistakes, he launched Vision Pro. But this will only expose his problems more prominently. So he will definitely take more measures to hide the errors, but that will lead to more mistakes. People often say that mistakes require more mistakes to cover up. We will see these issues within Apple.
Therefore, for smart people inside Apple, their best choice is to stay as far away from this project as possible, and it's wise to find a way to escape before the failure. This will ultimately impact the stock price. And Tim Cook is a stock price CEO. His position depends on the stock price.
If this happens, it could happen as early as 2024, the best possible successor at the moment is Elon Musk, provided he is willing."
6,What is this Apple Vision Pro?,It‚Äôs a Vr and Ar product newly launched by Apple . It‚Äôs going to be a game changer for Apple like the iPhone . Seeing the growing use of Virtusl and augmented technologies Apple has stepped in to carve a niche for itself in this arena
7,How can I earn money making apps for Apple Vision Pro?,"If you want to earn money by making apps for Apple's Vision Pro, there are a few steps you can take:
1. Learn the basics of app development: Before you can start making apps for Apple's Vision Pro, you need to have a solid understanding of app development. You can learn the basics of app development by taking online courses, attending workshops, or reading books on the subject.
2. Get familiar with Apple's Vision Pro: In order to develop apps for Apple's Vision Pro, you need to be familiar with the platform and its capabilities. You can learn more about Vision Pro by reading Apple's documentation and developer resources.
3. Create a portfolio of apps: Once you have a solid understanding of app development and are familiar with Vision Pro, you can start creating your own apps. Create a portfolio of apps that showcase your skills and demonstrate your ability to create high-quality apps.
4. Publish your apps on the App Store: Once you have created your apps, you can publish them on the App Store. This is where users can download and use your apps, and where you can earn money through in-app purchases, subscriptions, or advertising.
5. Promote your apps: In order to make money from your apps, you need to promote them to potential users. You can promote your apps through social media, online advertising, and other marketing channels.
6. Continuously update and improve your apps: To keep users engaged and interested in your apps, you need to continuously update and improve them. This will help you retain users and attract new ones, which can lead to more revenue over time."
8,Can Apple's Vision Pro succeed when Google Glass failed?,"Apple has sold out of the initial run - and did so on immediately.
So that‚Äôs something of a success already.
Apple is offering a best in class product which is doing two different things.
1) Offering a very compelling entertainment experience. A device for consuming movies and immersive content.
2) Making the claim that it is also a productivity tool. A place to get work done.
The entertainment offering seems very strong. The company seems to have refined the launch product to a point where reviewers are blown away by the immersive stuff.
The productivity claim, is to me a bit less convincing. I am certain that the company have done a great job with the user interface and the apps. I am just not entirely certain that everyone would want to do work in a virtual space - if that entails wearing a big-old headset for long periods. I am personally more productive with fewer windows and a single-tasking interface. A cloud of floating windows clamouring for my attention is not something beneficial so someone who has an attention deficit.
This product is generation one: a flag in the sand. A statement of intent. If first adopters respond well, then there will be later products which will build upon it. These future products will become‚Ä¶
Cheaper. The ‚Äúpro‚Äù suffix already suggests a non-pro offering.
Better. In terms of their visual fidelity
Lighter/thinner less intrusive. - It‚Äôs this last one which I think matters a great deal. For truly mass adoption and use in a workplace, the product will need to become much less obtrusive. Ideally becoming almost invisible.
If the company delivers on all three, then their idea of a visual computing device will succeed. Perhaps not to the same extent as the iPhone. But significant enough to be another substantial platform.
Google Glass was a technology demo which didn‚Äôt offer utility to anyone."
9,Can a dog use Apple Vision Pro?,No. And can‚Äôt buy one either. I dare anyone to buy on for their dog and train the dog to use it.
10,How does Apple Vision Pro understand hand gestures from various positions?,"Apple Vision Pro, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, is not a specific technology or product developed by Apple. However, Apple has various technologies and frameworks, such as Core ML and Vision, that enable developers to incorporate machine learning and computer vision capabilities into their applications.
Understanding hand gestures from various positions typically involves a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. Here's a general overview of how such systems can work:
Data collection: To train a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures, a large dataset of hand images or videos from various positions and angles needs to be collected. This dataset is usually labeled with corresponding gestures.
Feature extraction: Computer vision techniques are applied to extract relevant features from the collected hand images or videos. These features can include the position, orientation, shape, size, and movement of the hands, as well as the relative positions of the fingers.
Training a model: Machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are trained on the collected dataset. The extracted features from the previous step are used as input to the model, which learns to recognize patterns and associations between the input features and the corresponding hand gestures.
Testing and evaluation: After training, the model is tested on a separate dataset to assess its performance. This evaluation helps determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in recognizing hand gestures from various positions.
Real-time recognition: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be integrated into an application or system. In real-time, the system captures video or image input from a camera or other sensors. The captured input is then processed using the trained model, which recognizes and interprets the hand gestures based on the learned patterns and associations.
It's important to note that Apple may have developed proprietary technologies or frameworks since my knowledge cutoff that enhance hand gesture recognition or provide specialized tools for developers. Therefore, for the most accurate and up-to-date information on Apple's hand gesture recognition capabilities, I recommend referring to Apple's official documentation or announcements."
11,Will Apple's Vision Pro replace the flat-screen TV?,"No. Absolutely not.
For one thing, television-watching on a large-screen TV is a group activity. The Vision Pro is not.
Will the Vision Pro replace personal computer monitors?
Also no.
Even if that is what Apple first focussed on when we were first introduced to it.
(note, this section is copied and pasted from another of my answers)
Personal computing, and computing in general, goes through periodic step-changes each time the user interface changes.
We went from teletype and the command line to the GUI and the mouse. That made computing more accessible and it made us an order of magnitude more productive. I like to think of this as going from a one-dimensional interface to a two dimensional interface.
Bear in mind, GUI didn‚Äôt make the command line obsolete - it still exists. I literally use one every day. Still. In 2024. But far more of the tasks that we do use the GUI and far fewer people need to, or choose, to use the command line.
We went from a GUI with a mouse to touchscreens. This too made computing more accessible to more people, and made us more productive. I consider this going from a two-dimensional to two-and-a-half-dimensional interface.
Like with the GUI, touch didn‚Äôt make desktop computing obsolete - it still exists. But far more of the day to day tasks that we do use a touch device and far fewer people need to, or choose to, use a desktop.
I believe that the next two step-changes in computer interfaces are voice (like Alexa and Siri) in one direction (back to a one-dimensional interface), and a rich immersive three-dimensional interface in the other direction.
It‚Äôs not new. AR and VR have been around for some time now and pretty-much confined to being a novelty. Gaming is by far the most suitable application currently, and yet AR/VR is still a tiny proportion of the gaming market.
But, I believe, immersive 3D will become the user interface norm for General Computing.
Yes, I believe that we will achieve a productivity boost from Excel going immersive. Well, maybe not exactly Microsoft Excel, but normal computing applications. Once we eventually get through the novelty and gimmicks, and an uncanny valley of skeuomorphism that immersive 3D user interface will inevitably bring.
It‚Äôs hard to tell how and when immersive 3D interfaces will be used for general computing, but if anyone can give it a nudge in the right direction, it‚Äôll be Apple.
For AR/VR to be a serious platform, it needs better content and software. And, most of all, the development tools for applications developers.
Developing apps for an immersive platform is still very much like game development. Each game development engine (e.g Unity, Unreal etc.) has its own toolkit of UI elements, and they are very gamey, not necessarily suitable for general applications.
There are some nascent web standards to allow AR and VR content on the web. And they are still a little clunky to use. Until we have the equivalent of Bootstrap for AR/VR, not much is going to change
As Apple enters this space, they have the potential to change it from a niche industry to mainstream computing.
With the Vision Pro, Apple is bringing a device. Sure, it‚Äôs expensive. And it‚Äôs at least as cumbersome as the others already out there. But it‚Äôs a start.
From day one, Apple can come with the content. All the major blockbuster films of the last ten to fifteen years have been released in 3D. They have the iTunes Store and their ties to major studios, and their AppleTV+ service with the power to commission new content. They have just gone through a lot of effort to get music producers to move to spatial audio for Apple Music, you can see them influencing video content creators in a similar way.
Apple can bring the content creation tools. At the consumer end, iPhones already have stereoscopic cameras, so like we went from still photos to live photos, every picture or video we take could be a 3D one. Then they have the iMovie and Final Cut software to edit and put them together.
Apple can bring some of the social interactions ‚Äì Messages (formerly iMessage), FaceTime, AirPlay and SharePlay could form the basis of a shared experience. A space that both Meta and Microsoft have expressed serious interest in (but with little to show for it so far).
But most importantly, Apple will have the application development tools, extending the Xcode tools and already-existing APIs like ARKit to enable development of 3D and immersive applications, hopefully with a decent set of UI widgets and HCI guidelines, to allow third-party developers to make and sell AR and VR applications on the app store.
The Vision Pro is a step. The first step. I consider it an indication to developers, firstly by calling it ‚ÄúPro‚Äù, that there will be a range of devices and a platform with probably, in Apple fashion, yearly hardware updates. And by calling it VisionOS, also an indication that this is a viable platform from the same stable as macOS, iOS, iPadOS etc. (with lots of commonality) and will also most likely have yearly system updates. And the same set of developer APIs and tools they are already familiar with.
The Apple Vision Pro will not replace any of your existing devices. The Vision Pro will introduce early adopters to the potential of immersive three-dimensional computing."

13,Are you buying the Apple vision pro?,"I didn‚Äôt not think they are giving them away, yet they managed to blow through the first batch of 200,000 units, per reports. So yeah, I‚Äôll be buying it.
More specifically, I had planned to preorder, but had a nasty mishap in November which had me worried if my wallet would survive* so I‚Äôm sitting out round 1, but fully expect to be buying.
*yeah, US healthcare with private insurance, how did you guess?"
14,What are the features of the Apple Vision Pro 7?,"Here Are some Features of The Apple vision Pro 7:

15,What is the main purpose of Apple Vision Pro?,"Remove the need for a iPhone or MacBook. To me, it‚Äôs a stepping-stone to what Apple really wants to do: eyeglasses and contacts. Take everything that Vision Pro does and put it into eyeglasses and contacts that look and feel no different than regular eyeglasses or contacts, eventually making phones somewhat obsolete.
I feel like that‚Äôs the next logical step. You‚Äôll be able to type on a virtual keyboard, get map and turn-by-turn navigation right in your lenses, get info on landmarks, ratings on restaurants that you walk by, iMessages and email, YouTube, even FaceTime.
Apple reportedly wanted to release them by 2024, but they are still encountering too many hurdles, and the technology isn‚Äôt quite there yet. I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything before 2027 or 2028 (contacts are still a decade away at least) and until then, I‚Äôd just expect the iterations of Vision Pro to become smaller, cheaper, less-bulky, more battery-efficient, and likely transparent at some point, as they move closer to eyeglasses.
The endgame is for Apple to start moving away from phones and handheld devices and move towards AR. iPhones will likely still be around for a while, like the iPod was for a long time after the iPhone, but, as the technology matures, they‚Äôll likely become a kind of ‚Äúbackwater‚Äù stop for most people, and will no longer be Apple‚Äôs flagship device."
16,Do you think the Apple Vision Pro headset will succeed?,"Apple Vision Pro is the first step in Apples 'Spacial Computing‚Äò MasterPlan over the next 10years at least.
Apple has got the Budget and Revenue to support this plan, even if the first few years don‚Äôt see mass market adoption and don‚Äôt make profit.
From all the science fiction movies the future of computing can clearly be seen in VR/AR. Even if some imagination may seem dystopian, like Ready Player One.
I am certain they are already doing massive RnD into technologies that may enable stealth AR glasses or even contact lenses for the maybe even not so distant future.
It is up to developers to find new ways, how a 3D interface could look like. We have gotten so used to 2D interfaces in the past 30years, that it may not even be imaginable, how computer interfaces look like in 30 years.
To conclude: Imo Apples Vision Pro Gen1 will only see enthusiast and developer usage. But the first few generations will prepare the path to revolutionise the way of interfacing with computer visual interfaces."
17,Have you tried The Apple Vision Pro?,"Yes, which isn‚Äôt a very deep answer, but it wasn‚Äôt a deep question either.
I tried one, it worked poorly without inserts for my glasses prescription. Without my glasses I can see stuff like under five inches away great, but apparently the Vision Pro even being only an inch from my eyes acts like it is 1.4 meters (about five feet) away.
With the right inserts it is pretty good. I can make a 14‚Äô TV appear in my office. I can make a 5‚Äô Mac display appear. I can make a giant Safari window show up. Text isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúyeah I could read that‚Äù it is actually readable without eye strain. In the downside the pass through video is not good enough to read text well. Using my phone while I have the headset on sucks for example.
In the other hand if you misalign the headset it appears blurry and also the eye tracking is ‚Äúoff‚Äù and it is hard to select small objects.
The VR equivalent of ‚Äúdesktop wallpaper‚Äù is amazing. My brain thinks I‚Äôm actually at Mt Hood, or in the desert, or whenever. It is an amazing effect. I know it isn‚Äôt real but if I‚Äôm not actively disbelieving it my brain goes right back to thinking I‚Äôm there.
on the downside if you don‚Äôt want a huge private TV/movie theater there isn‚Äôt all that much I can say would make me want to pay $3.5k for it right now. I mean I already did, but I also run an iOS consulting business which makes this a legit business expense so pretax money, and I might even write a real app for it. I do actually use it for business (the giant Mac display and rendering some debugging data in 3-space). If I couldn‚Äôt pay for it that way I would need to justify the cost for a TV my wife can‚Äôt see/share. If I were single though sure I would buy it in a heartbeat."
18,How much is the Apple Vision Pro headset?,"According to TechCrunch the headset will $3499.00 US. It‚Äôs due out in early 2024. I think a Wired article listed the price as $3500.00.
The Apple Vision Pro headset will cost $3499, out early 2024
Apple Vision Pro will retail for $3,499, and it will be available for purchase in early 2024.
https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/the-apple-vision-pro-headset-will-cost-3499-out-early-2024/"
19,What do you think the outcome of the Apple Vision Pro will be?,"Personal computing, and computing in general, goes through periodic step-changes each time the user interface changes.
We went from teletype and the command line to the GUI and the mouse. That made computing more accessible and it made us an order of magnitude more productive. I like to think of this as going from a one-dimensional interface to a two dimensional interface.
Bear in mind, GUI didn‚Äôt make the command line obsolete - it still exists. I literally use one every day. Still. In 2024. But far more of the tasks that we do use the GUI and far fewer people need to, or choose, to use the command line.
We went from a GUI with a mouse to touchscreens. This too made computing more accessible to more people, and made us more productive. I consider this going from a two-dimensional to two-and-a-half-dimensional interface.
Like with the GUI, touch didn‚Äôt make desktop computing obsolete - it still exists. But far more of the day to day tasks that we do use a touch device and far fewer people need to, or choose to, use a desktop.
I believe that the next two step-changes in computer interfaces are voice (like Alexa and Siri) in one direction (back to a one-dimensional interface), and a rich immersive three-dimensional interface in the other direction.
It‚Äôs not new. AR and VR have been around for some time now and pretty-much confined to being a novelty. Gaming is by far the most suitable application currently, and yet AR/VR is still a tiny proportion of the gaming market.
But, I believe, immersive 3D will become the user interface norm for General Computing.
Yes, I believe that we will achieve a productivity boost from Excel going immersive. Well, maybe not exactly Microsoft Excel, but normal computing applications. Once we eventually get through the novelty and gimmicks, and an uncanny valley of skeuomorphism that immersive 3D user interface will inevitably bring.
It‚Äôs hard to tell how and when immersive 3D interfaces will be used for general computing, but if anyone can give it a nudge in the right direction, it‚Äôll be Apple.
For AR/VR to be a serious platform, it needs better content and software. And, most of all, the development tools for applications developers.
Developing apps for an immersive platform is still very much like game development. Each game development engine (e.g Unity, Unreal etc.) has its own toolkit of UI elements, and they are very gamey, not necessarily suitable for general applications.
There are some nascent web standards to allow AR and VR content on the web. And they are still a little clunky to use. Until we have the equivalent of Bootstrap for AR/VR, not much is going to change
As Apple enters this space, they have the potential to change it from a niche industry to mainstream computing.
With the Vision Pro, Apple is bringing a device. Sure, it‚Äôs expensive. And it‚Äôs at least as cumbersome as the others already out there. But it‚Äôs a start.
From day one, Apple can come with the content. All the major blockbuster films of the last ten to fifteen years have been released in 3D. They have the iTunes Store and their ties to major studios, and their AppleTV+ service with the power to commission new content. They have just gone through a lot of effort to get music producers to move to spatial audio for Apple Music, you can see them influencing video content creators in a similar way.
Apple can bring the content creation tools. At the consumer end, iPhones already have stereoscopic cameras, so like we went from still photos to live photos, every picture or video we take could be a 3D one. Then they have the iMovie and Final Cut software to edit and put them together.
Apple can bring some of the social interactions ‚Äì Messages (formerly iMessage), FaceTime, AirPlay and SharePlay could form the basis of a shared experience. A space that both Meta and Microsoft have expressed serious interest in (but with little to show for it so far).
But most importantly, Apple will have the application development tools, extending the Xcode tools and already-existing APIs like ARKit to enable development of 3D and immersive applications, hopefully with a decent set of UI widgets and HCI guidelines, to allow third-party developers to make and sell AR and VR applications on the app store.
The Vision Pro is a step. The first step. I consider it an indication to developers, firstly by calling it ‚ÄúPro‚Äù, that there will be a range of devices and a platform with probably, in Apple fashion, yearly hardware updates. And by calling it VisionOS, also an indication that this is a viable platform from the same stable as macOS, iOS, iPadOS etc. (with lots of commonality) and will also most likely have yearly system updates. And the same set of developer APIs and tools they are already familiar with.
The outcome will be that it will be seen as a platform worth developing software for."
20,What is the main purpose of Apple Vision Pro?,"If you were around when the iPhone came out you might recall that it was cool device but a curiously barren one until partners started building Apps for it. For the cost, the iphone was not a sensible purchase on release.
The purpose of the Vision Pro is to capture the power and creativity of app developers in the augmented reality space. In a few years, with apps we cant even imagine fully, it could change the way some professions work dramatically and pave the way for everyone to want its power for some app or other. This is not sure thing and it is impossible to tell if this is finally the ‚ÄúAR moment‚Äú we have been promised. The Vision Pro might not be up to the task, customers might not be ready to make use of it, or developers might not be ready to make killer AR apps. But I feel like with advanced AI integration, we will see some interesting things on the platform. I don‚Äôt intend to lay out $4k (with tax and AppleCare) until its proven with AR apps I would use and even then I would hope to see price drops due to the economy of scale."

22,What are the key features of the Apple Vision Pro?,"Apple Vision Pro is a brand-new virtual reality headset. It was announced on June 8, 2023, and a release date of 2024 has been set.
The Apple Vision Pro has the following key features:
* Display with extremely high resolution:** Each of the two ultra-high-resolution displays in the Vision Pro has 23 million pixels. This is multiple times the goal of the Oculus Journey 2, and it gives a substantially more vivid VR experience.
* **Spatial audio:** A 360-degree soundscape is created by the built-in spatial audio system in the Vision Pro. This causes it to feel like you are encircled by sound, and it improves the drenching of VR encounters.
Hand tracking:* The Vision Ace purposes hand following to permit you to interface with VR content without utilizing regulators. As a result, VR feels more natural and easy to use, and you can use your hands for other things.
*Focus on the eyes:** The Vision Pro follows your gaze with eye tracking. This can be utilized to control VR content, and it can likewise be utilized to give criticism on your presentation in VR games.
* **Passthrough mode:** You can see the real world through the headset in passthrough mode on the Vision Pro. This can be used to take breaks from VR as well as to keep track of your surroundings.
The Apple Vision Pro is a powerful and immersive virtual reality headset that has the potential to change how we interact with digital media. It is certain to be a popular option among professionals, gamers, and fans of entertainment.
Here are a portion of the likely utilizations of the Apple Vision Genius:
* Gambling: The Apple Vision Pro could be used to make games that are extremely realistic. In a realistic way, players could interact with virtual objects and even see their own hands and arms in the virtual world.
Entertainment: * With the Apple Vision Pro, you could watch movies and TV shows more fully. It is possible for viewers to interact with the characters and objects depicted on screen, giving them the impression of being in the thick of the action.
Productivity: * Using the Apple Vision Pro could make project work simpler. Multiple windows and documents could be viewed simultaneously by users, and they could even interact with them in three dimensions.
* [Education]: Learning could be made more engaging and interactive with the help of the Apple Vision Pro. In a shared virtual space, students could even collaborate with other students to explore virtual models of real-world objects.
The Apple Vision Pro could be used for a lot more than just these kinds of things. This product has the potential to change the way we interact with digital content, in my opinion."
23,Who is getting an Apple Vision Pro?,"As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I do not have information about specific individuals who might be getting the Apple Vision Pro, as it is not possible for me to access real-time data or individual purchase information. Additionally, Apple Vision Pro is not a product that was known to me at that time.
If Apple has released a product called ""Apple Vision Pro"" after my last update, I recommend checking the latest news, Apple's official announcements, or their website for the most up-to-date information on product releases and customer adoption."
24,"Which would you choose, the newest iPhone or an Apple Vision Pro?","It ultimately depends on your needs and preferences. If you prioritize having the latest smartphone features, such as advanced camera capabilities, performance improvements, and software updates, you may prefer the newest iPhone. However, if you prioritize augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences, the Apple Vision Pro could be a better choice, as it is specifically designed for immersive visual experiences."
25,Would you consider Apple Vision Pro to be dystopian or revolutionary?,"Well, is the mobile phone dystopian or revolutionary? How about the laptop computer? Or for that matter, that automobile?
Mobile phone: Revolutionary! Puts unprecedented communications power in your pocket, and allows widespread teaching and skills sharing. Dystopian: Draws excess attention from other activities and allows widespread creating and dissemination of propaganda.
Laptop computer: Revolutionary! Puts new powers of creation and learning into the hands of many. Dystopian: Too expensive for everyone to have one, exacerbates class divides. Creates poisonous e-Waste.
Automobile: Revolutionary! Allows unprecedented personal mobility, allows greater independence and ability to take good jobs far from a good home. Dystopian. Creates pollution, dismantles city landscapes, creates parking and traffic crises, wasted untold hours commuting.
So, then. Apple Vision Pro?
Unquestionably revolutionary. The promise of a scalable augmented reality platform has been a dream for a very long time. This can make tasks easier, people more productive, learning more immersive, and open new vistas for entertainment.
However, one can imagine a dystopian future where people are locked into their augmented worlds, isolated from their fellow humans, and unable to operate without their prosthetic augmentations. Class divides can also be exacerbated by placing advantages of augmented existences out of reach for many."
26,Is Apple Vision Pro available for purchase worldwide?,"No, Apple Vision Pro is not currently available for purchase worldwide. As of today, February 14, 2024, it is only available in the United States. Apple has announced plans to bring it to more countries later this year, but no specific date or list of countries has been announced yet.

27,Why is the Apple Vision Pro only available in the US?,"As I don't have access to real-time information or specific details about Apple's product availability. However, it's not uncommon for companies to release products in specific markets or regions initially and then gradually expand availability to other countries.
There can be various reasons why the Apple Vision Pro or any other product may have limited availability in certain regions. Some possible factors could include:
Market Testing and Demand: Companies often choose to release products in specific markets as a way to gauge customer interest and test the market demand before expanding to other regions. This approach allows them to assess the product's reception and make necessary adjustments before launching it globally.
Regulatory Requirements: Different countries have their own regulatory standards and certification processes that need to be met for products to be sold in those regions. Ensuring compliance with local regulations can take time and resources, which might result in delayed availability in certain countries.
Distribution and Supply Chain Logistics: Expanding product availability to multiple countries involves establishing and managing distribution channels and supply chain logistics. Companies may need to establish partnerships with local retailers or carriers to ensure efficient distribution and support for their products.
Language and Localization: Before launching a product in a new market, companies often invest in localization efforts, including adapting the product's user interface, documentation, and customer support to the local language and cultural preferences. This process takes time and resources.
It's important to note that product availability can change over time, and companies like Apple often expand the availability of their products to additional countries based on factors such as demand, market conditions, and production capabilities. If the Apple Vision Pro is currently only available in the US, there is a possibility that it may become available in other regions in the future. Checking Apple's official website or contacting their customer support would provide the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the availability of their products in specific countries."
28,Is it worth buying an Apple Vision Pro?,"Thanks for asking,
Until unless you are using it for multi tasking of many apps which are related to like office, coding , mixing and gaming type applications and the same to be done in a single device and don‚Äôt want to use multiple devices‚Ä¶
Thank you‚Ä¶"
29,What are the concerns over Apple's Vision Pro headsets?,"I suppose the first concern was regarding its weight on your head. The second was about vertigo or nausea from extended use. A third might be whether the tech innovation was superior enough to warrant the price.
Most reviews have responded to the weight issue with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù as they didn‚Äôt seem bothered by it, and quickly adapted after a few days.
The accuracy of the ‚Äúpass through‚Äù video is helping reduce the sense of disconnect with the real world and seems to be much less of an issue than with some other headsets. Only one person I‚Äôve seen review the Vision Pro reported some discomfort.
The tech experience is so compelling and impressive that most reviews have addressed the development as very impressive and some say a game changer in terms of clarity, visual accuracy and reliable interface operation. Some even suggested, after experiencing how quickly you learn to use it, that it was way ahead of anything else they had seen before.
There may be other concerns your question was hinting at, but these three were the most mentioned in all the many reviews I have seen or read since it was released."
30,Why does the Apple Vision Pro exist?,"After a fashion, it doesn‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt released to the public for sale yet. It is an evolution of Apple‚Äôs user interface roadmap. It will allow existing apps to take advantage of this new technology and allow for new technologies to use it."
31,Can I use Apple Vision Pro for professional work?,"I‚Äôve seen it used for working a Mac that runs Final Cut Pro. By itself, you could still be using it for many professional tasks. I guess that depends on what professional work you are talking about. There isn‚Äôt an AutoCAD for it yet. But I‚Äôm sure 3D visualization is one of the things people..."
32,Is the Apple Vision Pro safe for the eyes? Do you think it will replace phones in the near future?,"We have had VR headsets available to the public for seven or so years now and nobody has published any research papers showing any dangers to the eyes. The Vision Pro doesn‚Äôt have any technology that seems like it could be any more dangerous then the older VR headsets. So as far as anyone can tell it ought to be fine.
However if you are worried about it maybe skip being an early adopter and let the people who have nearly $4k to spend on it be a guinea pig and do your medical testing for you.
The Vision Pro weighs dramatically more then a phone, takes a minute or three to strap to your head, has only a two and a half-ish hour battery life, looks rather ridiculous and costs about 4x what an expensive phone costs. I don‚Äôt see and danger of it replacing phones until most of those issues are addressed."
33,What is EyeSight in Apple Vision Pro?,EyeSight is an eye-tracking feature in Apple Vision Pro that lets others know when you are using the headset or fully immersed in an AR experience.
34,What programming language should I learn to make something like Apple Vision Pro?,"Preferably something that has access to various accelerators in the M2 SoC, which probably anything that has LLVM backend support. However, there could be the best support is in Apple‚Äôs own preferred language: Swift.
If we‚Äôre talking about of Apple context, anything that can target native code will do. C, C++, Pascal, Rust, Nim, Assembly, etc. you have plenty of options. I believe programming language is one of the tiniest part you have to worry about when making something like Apple Vision Pro, as the challenge in hardware is magnitude higher. Oculus even allows slower languages like JavaScript and C#, showing language choice isn‚Äôt that significant. At least if you want to use its SDK or higly optimized engines like Unity, where your code doesn‚Äôt have to be the one that‚Äôs working hard."
35,"Is the Apple Vision Pro worth buying for $3,500?",If it suits your needs yes.
36,What sets Apple Vision Pro apart from other visual devices?,"A few things jumped out for me.
It is by far the best quality hardware of any VR headset. And this is reflected in its price.
It is built on a stable and mature platform - macOS, iOS, iPadOS - with innovative, stable, and mature development tools
With the initial release, Apple has focused on presenting 2D experiences in a 3D space but has not shown any significant immersive experience (VR) or adding information to pass-through video (AR). They also did not feature (promote) any third-party applications that do so. While it is clear that the hardware is very capable of both. This says to me they released it too early, it‚Äôs more a developer kit than a consumer product.
I expect to see great things at the developer‚Äôs conference in June."
37,Can Apple Vision Pro remotely turn on the AC?,"Apple's Vision Pro, also known as Apple Vision Framework, primarily focuses on computer vision and image processing capabilities, enabling developers to incorporate features like object recognition, image classification, and facial recognition into their apps. It does not have direct functionality for controlling household appliances like an air conditioner.However, Apple does offer HomeKit, a platform for controlling smart home devices, including air conditioners, through compatible apps and devices. With HomeKit-enabled air conditioners and a compatible HomeKit hub (such as an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad), you can remotely control your AC using the Home app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or through Siri voice commands.To remotely control your air conditioner using HomeKit, you typically need a smart air conditioning unit that supports HomeKit integration or a smart plug that can turn the AC on or off. Once set up, you can use the Home app or Siri commands to adjust the temperature, turn the AC on or off, and create schedules or automations.While Apple's Vision Pro framework doesn't directly facilitate remote control of AC units, HomeKit provides the infrastructure for integrating smart home devices, including air conditioners, into the Apple ecosystem for remote control and automation."
38,What are the features and technical specifications of Apple Vision Pro?,"The Apple Vision Pro is Apple's spatial computer device. Here are its features and technical specifications based on the information provided:
Display: It uses high-resolution color cameras to show you the real world and a display on the front to show your eyes to other people. The display type is Micro-OLED with a total of 23 million pixels. This suggests a per-eye resolution of around 3400√ó3400 for a square aspect ratio, or around 3680√ó3140 for the 7:6 aspect ratio.
Operating System: It runs on visionOS.
Lens Adjustment: Fully Automatic.

39,Why exactly did Apple choose to make the Apple Vision Pro?,"There is a future for computing which will eliminate the screen, keyboard, mouse, and allow us to interact easily using our eyes instead of hands. No more repetitive stress injuries, no more monitors burning energy, much fewer cables, and far less hardware to dispose of when upgrading your system.
The Vision system is not meant to replace reality but to augment it when you need to get something done. Anything you are now doing with (or on) a screen will be replaced by a head-mounted viewing device. We‚Äôre not yet clear on how much of this new paradigm will rely on fast internet and cloud access to work smoothly but if things advance beyond 5G wireless connectivity we might find our office travels with us instead of occupying a whole room.
It isn‚Äôt yet clear how much entertainment will be consumed with the Vision device but the resolution of the images at very high frame rates suggests that 3D content may make a comeback along with some other stylistic elements in future content to amplify the immersive experience.
like the desktop Macs, the MacBooks, the iPhone and the iPad, the real measure of success will come when scads of developers bring forward some innovative applications to run on the system. It might also take some time before developers can wrap their minds around the potential.
No controllers, hand devices, gloves, or external sensors to buy. I can‚Äôt wait to watch something with immersive audio to go along with my tour of the Palaeolithic era.
So, that‚Äôs why I think Apple made the Apple Vision Pro."
40,I understand that nearsighted people (with myopia) will require corrective lenses to use the Apple Vision Pro. What about farsighted people?,"Apple has recently unveiled the much-anticipated Apple Vision Pro, an augmented reality (AR) headset currently in development.

Let's delve into the official details of the Vision Pro, covering its impressive specifications, standout features, robust privacy measures, and much more. know more"
41,Will the Apple Vision Pro be available internationally?,"At launch date it will be available only in USA apparently, then there are rumors that it will come later in 2024 to United Kingdom and Canada, followed after that by Asia and the rest of Europe. Most of this are rumors so take it with a grain of salt. In short, no, it won't be available internationally at first."
42,Have you tried Apple Vision Pro yet? What's your feedback?,
43,Is Apple Vision Pro like a computer for your face ($3500)?,"Apple Vision Pro is not a computer for your face, but rather an innovative augmented reality (AR) headset developed by Apple. Priced at $3500, it offers a groundbreaking visual experience by combining advanced optics, sensors, and powerful processing capabilities. The Apple Vision Pro allows users to overlay digital information onto the real world, creating immersive AR experiences.

46,Why are a lot of people broke to buy the Apple Vision Pro?,"There could be several reasons why many people might find it difficult to afford the Apple Vision Pro or any other expensive product. Here are a few possible factors:
High cost: The Apple Vision Pro is a premium product with advanced features, and as such, it carries a significant price tag. The high cost makes it unaffordable for a large portion of the population, particularly those with limited financial resources.
Income disparities: Economic inequalities exist in society, meaning that people have varying levels of income and wealth. The price of the Apple Vision Pro may be beyond the means of individuals who fall into lower income brackets or who are struggling financially.
Priorities and budgeting: People have different financial priorities and allocate their resources accordingly. Some individuals may choose to spend their money on essential needs, such as housing, food, and healthcare, rather than luxury items like the Apple Vision Pro.
Lack of savings: Many people live paycheck to paycheck without significant savings. In such cases, it can be challenging to gather the necessary funds to make large purchases, especially if they require saving for an extended period of time.
Debt and financial obligations: Some individuals may have significant debt burdens, such as student loans, credit card debt, or medical bills. These financial obligations can restrict their ability to allocate funds towards non-essential items like the Apple Vision Pro.
Limited access to credit: Not everyone has easy access to credit or the ability to take on additional debt to finance a purchase. Without available credit options, individuals may find it difficult to afford expensive products upfront.
It's important to note that these reasons are general and may not apply to everyone. People's financial situations can vary greatly, and personal circumstances play a significant role in determining their ability to afford certain products."
47,Are we wrong about the Apple Vision Pro?,"This question has so many problems. You ask ‚Äúare we wrong about‚Äù something, but do not state your position, so how can someone even posit an answer? And your opinion, right or wrong, is based on what exactly? The product has not shipped yet and won‚Äôt for months. So you can‚Äôt in most likelihood had a chance to try it yourself. Have you watched some videos from the few folks who had a chance to try a pre-production model out for a try. Any link I could offer would be considered spam, so I can‚Äôt do that. Perhaps if you clarify in a followup comment, we can discuss this further. Also, you ask the question ‚ÄúAre we wrong,‚Ä¶‚Äù who else are you speaking on behalf of? Have you and these others, been wrong about something else in the future? What is your experience and expertise? What is your track record on predictions?"
48,Will the Apple vision pro have cellular modem and will people use the vision pro more than smartphones?,"Apple does not discuss cellular technology at all on their website for the Vision Pro. This leads me to believe the answer is likely no, that Apple Vision Pro will not have a cellular modem.
Regardless of the cellular question, people will not use Vosion Pro more than smartphone, there are too many smart phones, and they won‚Äôt use vision pro more than their iPhone, because the Vision Pro battery won‚Äôt last long enough to use it all day. You will be lucky to get more than 1 hour of use out of it without being plugged into a power source.
This is a niche product that will have a very small user base, because of price, and size. People won‚Äôt be able to just walk around with these on their heads all day, so they need some way to store them. Think of this as being like the very first cell phone. Big, bulky, and not very mobile. Maybe in 10 to 20 years the technology will advance to something that is very portable but we are nowhere lose to that at this time."
49,What do you get in Apple Vision Pro?,"Apple Vision Pro offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features tailored to enhance productivity, creativity, and efficiency in professional settings. Users benefit from advanced image and video editing capabilities, including precise color grading, seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem, and powerful AI-driven tools for tasks like object removal and scene enhancement.

50,Apple Vision Pro is among us. Are you ready?,It won‚Äôt really be among us until 2024. And at a starting price of $3500 and little value beyond ‚Äúgee whiz‚Äù I can‚Äôt imagine ever buying one.
51,What professions don't need MR headsets like Apple Vision Pro?,"Lots of professions likely won't need MR headsets like Apple Vision Pro! Here are a few examples:
People who mostly work with physical objects: Farmers, construction workers, plumbers, chefs, etc. Their jobs depend on touch and manipulation, which wouldn't translate well to the digital world.
Those who deal with large, open spaces: Pilots, bus drivers, delivery personnel, etc. Wearing a headset could be dangerous or impractical in these situations.
Those who prioritize personal interaction: Teachers, therapists, salespeople, etc. Building real-world connections is key, and headsets might create barriers.
Those on a budget: These headsets are likely expensive, and many professions won't justify the cost.
But remember, technology evolves quickly! This list might change as MR headsets become more affordable and versatile."
52,How does a person with shortsightedness use Apple Vision Pro?,"Optically the display on the Vision Pro is about 2 meters (about 5 feet) away. If you need glasses to see at that distance you will need to send your prescription to Apple who will forward them to ZEISS. You send the distance prescription and zeiss can modify it for the actual focus distance. You will get optical inserts that magnetically attach & the gaze detection will adjust to the inserts (you need to scan a QR code to pair them).
They also have ‚Äúreaders‚Äù in a few strengths if you need non prescription glasses to see at that distance.
Apple
has more details on the process."
53,"What is the significance of the ""Apple Vision Pro"" in the digital renaissance?","I‚Äôm going to climb right out onto this new limb in the computing tree by saying that this new head-mounted display concept is going to change the way we think about computing. Not about entertainment, or gaming, or exploring virtual worlds, but it will put everything I need to operate my computers, iPads, and TV with just my fingers. The window interface familiar to all Mac users will remain the same. The gestural interface is truly comfortable and the eye tracking functionality completely removes the need for a mouse or trackpad to select or navigate your workspace.
My sense of it is that I usually sit alone at my keyboard for a few hours working on some projects which is my profession. Sitting alone with my Vision goggles for a few hours will turn out to be just as easy. And‚Ä¶. If the interface responds more quickly to where I‚Äôm looking than does my trackpad, then I might be finishing my project quicker than before. The Vision Pro system is completely compatible with all the different ways my devices interact with each other. Continuity (where one device hands off to another) will allow me to include all my devices in my workflow wirelessly.
We might still need a separate webcam in the short run as it seems the digital me is proving difficult to deploy without creeping out others not using avatars of themselves, but I‚Äôm also open to the novelty of using my Mac ‚Äúmemoji‚Äù as my avatar since most of my circle of friends and family have already seen me use it. But the expressiveness of my avatar might be significantly enhanced by my eye-tracking and facial expressions being more accurate, subtle and responsive because of the sensors and cameras on my face.
The other marvellous thing about this new computer interface is how it uses the existing Mac platform and Applications and there isn‚Äôt a completely new learning curve. I also can‚Äôt wait to see what accessibility features are coming with the device once it gets into the right hands.
This is as significant a departure from desktop computing as the iPhone was to the flip phone and Blackberry. No more monitors covering your desk, reduced power use, and with new immersive computing without having to buy so many peripheral devices this has the potential to reshape the whole notion of what desktop computing looks like. All other implementations of a head-mounted display have been tied to a particular platform (with its focus on one activity to the exclusion of other uses. An Occulus was never designed to be a computer interface. It comes with the purpose already built in. Just as the programmable phone broke open the confining world of cell phones the Vision Pro is going to be so flexible as to redefine the head-worn device market.
So, that‚Äôs my first take on the Vision Pro. I reserve the right to change my mind when it actually ships but I feel I won‚Äôt need to based on Apple‚Äôs history of making a new thing better instead of inventing it."
54,Will eye tracking on Apple's Vision Pro work with people who have amblyopia?,"The accuracy and effectiveness of eye tracking technology, such as Apple's Vision Pro, for individuals with amblyopia can vary depending on the severity and specific characteristics of the condition. Amblyopia, commonly known as ""lazy eye,"" is a visual disorder where one eye has reduced visual acuity compared to the other.
Eye tracking technology typically relies on detecting the movement and position of the eyes to provide input or control various functions. While individuals with amblyopia may experience reduced visual acuity in one eye, their eye movements can still be tracked and measured using eye tracking systems.
However, the effectiveness of eye tracking technology for people with amblyopia may be influenced by factors such as the extent of visual acuity loss, the stability of eye movements, and the ability of the amblyopic eye to fixate on specific points accurately.
It's important to note that I am an AI language model, and the availability and specifics of Apple's Vision Pro and its compatibility with different conditions may be subject to change. For accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting official sources such as Apple's documentation or reaching out to Apple directly for details on the specific capabilities and compatibility of their eye tracking technology with amblyopia."
55,"What apps does Apple Vision Pro support, and how do I use them?","""Apple Vision Pro is a creative and innovative canvas as well as a platform for content consumption. Developers may create ground-breaking games that push the edges of what‚Äôs possible, interactive apps, and immersive AR experiences with the help of strong developer tools and APIs.""

7. Learning Curve: Learning to navigate and interact within virtual or augmented environments can have a learning curve, especially for users who are new to these technologies. The Vision Pro headset's user interface and interaction methods may require a period of adjustment.
These potential drawbacks are not specific to the Vision Pro headset but are general considerations associated with VR and AR devices. For accurate information on the specific drawbacks or limitations of the Vision Pro headset, it would be necessary to refer to official announcements, product documentation, or reviews once the headset is released."
66,When and where can we buy the Apple Vision Pro?,"Nowhere, Apple has not released them yet."
67,In what ways does Apple Vision Pro blend artistry and technology?,"Products have 2 things. Experience, and measurable performance.
Apple has top level designers and engineers. Probably earning salaries of $100,000 to $500,000. Apple has more of the top level people, and also better machinery/tools, and bigger budget. That helps them achieve the best products in terms of performance, and experience.
Apple Vision Pro is early and best. And, improving at a very fast speed. It‚Äôs going to be an insurmountable lead by Apple. Again, with the best design, best ux, which is the artistry part. And, the technology Is high performance, and ux is objectively optimized for speed and ease of use which are parts of performance."
68,What is the best alternative device of Apple Vision Pro?,"As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a specific device called ""Apple Vision Pro."" It's possible that you may be referring to a hypothetical product that emerged after my last update. Can you provide more details or clarify what you're referring to so I can better assist you in finding an alternative?"
69,What are your thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro headset?,"The big news in the tech world right now, in case you've been living under a rock, is the Apple Vision Pro ‚Äî Apple's new mixed-reality headset, which blends augmented and virtual reality into a single, sleek device. It was revealed on June 5 at Apple's WWDC conference in Cupertino ‚Äî where, as it just so happens, I was lucky enough to try the Vision Pro for about 30 minutes.
During the brief demo, Apple walked me through the setup process and I got to experience a number of VR and AR experiences. I was able to take a FaceTime call, check out some immersive videos and photos, browse the web with multiple windows opened, watch a few 3D movie clips and more.
The Vision Pro is unlike pretty much any other AR / VR headset, in that it doesn't require any extra hardware for you to control it. It's decked out with a multitude of cameras and sensors for eye-tracking and hand-tracking ‚Äî and it works remarkably well.
To move your (mouse) pointer, you just look at the app or virtual button you want to press, and then tap your pointer finger and thumb together (either hand works); this acts as a click. To scroll, simply hold those same fingers together and pull up or down, left or right. It takes a bit of practice, but after a few minutes, it's pretty intuitive. Honestly, it's pretty incredible.
The other neat thing is, it doesn't really matter where your hands are placed. You can have them out in front of you or resting at your side, and the device will still detect your movements. The cameras in the Vision Pro can do a remarkably good job at picking up your clicks and scrolls without making you work that hard. It feels natural and relaxed.
So basically it is a great product from Apple, but looking at the price, it is not going to be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. üòÄ"
70,How can Apple's Vision Pro headset be used safely?,"Apple's Vision Pro headset is designed to provide a high-quality and immersive virtual reality experience. To ensure safe usage of this headset, it is important to follow these guidelines:

71,Will you be pre-ordering Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing device?,"I don't have the ability to make purchases or pre-orders, as I am a text-based AI developed by OpenAI. My purpose is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge and abilities. As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have specific details about an ""Apple Vision Pro spatial computing device.""
If Apple has released a new product or made announcements after my last update, I recommend checking the official Apple website or reliable news sources for the latest information on any new devices, including availability, features, and pre-order options."
72,"Is it true that Apple vision pro will take over the iPhone, iPad and iMac in 2024 and will Samsung and Google and others be doing the same as well?","It will take time for the Vision Pro to gain followers because right now it is relying on developers to port their apps to Vision Pro.
Right now, Apple is in a weak marketing position because there are no new features for the iPhone 15 series except for the change to USB-C connectors. It looks like Apple is putting more marketing weight behind Apple Watch than the iPhone.
This has left Apple severely exposed in its single largest market, China. Huawei has introduced the Mate 60 Pro, which enables satellite voice communications, and has much higher network connection speeds than Apple, Samsung and Google, who all rely on Qualcomm for their 5G transceivers.
The current version of the Vision Pro is priced at $3500, which means that only early adapters will buy it. A cheaper version will likely not come out until 2024/25.
I expect a lot of buzz about Huawei products even though they will not be readily available in the US due to sanctions.
Tough times for Apple and Samsung."
73,Why is the Apple Vision Pro priced at $3500?,"Like any other Apple product, Vision Pro comes with a hefty price.
That‚Äôs pretty much because of the Apple R1(yes, a new one after the Bionics and M series) which is a monster SoC the size of a bean. It's not the only thing, there is also an Apple M2 doing its job of handling the VUI.
R1‚Äôs main job is to process just everything the cameras, microphones, and other sensors. There are 12 cameras onboard. The R1 achiev..."
74,Why are random cracks appearing on Apple Vision Pro headsets?,"Thanks for asking,
Vision Pro‚Äôs outer shell cracking due to the heat. Because the present enthusiasts (buyers) are going too crazy with that to get 200% output from that 3500$ toy. So the cameras on the outer side of Vision Pro are heating as they are doing most of there crazy works out side the room. So the Vision Pro‚Äôs outer cameras are rendering continuously and the heat from cameras and there sensors can‚Äôt be resisted by the Vision Pro‚Äôs outer shell plastic‚Ä¶
Thank you‚Ä¶"
75,What kind of hardware is included in Apple's Vision Pro headset?,"Exact Hardware specifications details will not be released till it is launched, however based on the reveal in June 2023 WWDC below are the HW used in Apple Vision Pro :
Hardware:
Apple M2 Silicon,
Apple new R1 Chip,
12 Cameras,
Aluminium alloy frame,

Micro-OLED display with 23 million pixels,
Zeiss Vision Correction Lenses which will be sold separately
Advanced Lens,
Various Sensors"
76,Are there any limitations or drawbacks to using Apple's Vision Pro that users should be aware of?,"Same as any other or inferior AR devices.
The places you can use it are pretty water averse. That includes you sweating into the thing.
If you have amblyopia, crossed eyes du to either them simply being crossed, or your retinas being to the outside of their normal central locations, or if you are colorblind, you may feel physically ill using the thing.
The thing doesn‚Äôt tie proprioception to directional control directly, so badly written software can result in nausea and vertigo (you can solve that one by not buying badly written software).
If you wear the things while driving, just as you can put things into someone‚Äôs visual field? You can edit them out. Like, say, a pedestrian.
Eye tracking ‚Äújumps‚Äù if you have nystagmus of any kind. Like if you are drunk, or do meth. When the cop is giving you a field sobriety test, and they have you follow the pen? they aren‚Äôt watching to see if you follow the pen, they are watching for your eye tracking to jump, due to horizontal gaze nystagmus. Sober people will evenly follow the pen; drunk or stoned people‚Äôs eyes will jump instead.
Vertical gaze nystagmus from a traumatic brain injury, like a contrecoup injury to your visual cortex will have a similar effect, as will ALS or MS.
If you have one eye, then they fail to provide the stereo effect.
If you have a hook for a hand, you can‚Äôt really use the touch controls; but that‚Äôs true of trackpads and touchscreens, like an iPad or an iPhone.
If you are blind, since they are pretty much a display device, they are going to be practically useless to you.
The more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù a technology becomes, the less usable it is to someone with a physical handicap."
77,What are the technical specifications of the Apple Vision Pro?,Until it is officially released there will be no specs provided to the public by Apple.
78,"Apple announced the soon to be released Apple Vision Pro, will this change everything just like the iPhone did?","This tech won‚Äôt become widely adopted until either a) it becomes far more fashionable / practical or b) the utility of the device is so compelling it‚Äôs appearance just doesn‚Äôt matter.
I wouldn‚Äôt walk around with that thing strapped on my head and I have no problem not owning one, so it seems they‚Äôre a ways away."
79,"""Is it possible to play virtual reality games on an Apple Vision Pro?""?","As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there is no specific information about a product called ""Apple Vision Pro."" It's possible that new products or updates may have been released since then.
As of my last information, Apple has not released a dedicated virtual reality (VR) headset, but they have been actively working on augmented reality (AR) technologies, including ARKit for iOS devices. The closest Apple product related to VR is the macOS support for external VR headsets through Metal 2 framework.
If ""Apple Vision Pro"" is a product released or announced after my last update, I recommend checking the official Apple website, product announcements, or contacting Apple support for the most accurate and up-to-date information. If Apple has released a dedicated VR headset or any other product related to virtual reality, details about its compatibility with VR games would be provided in the product specifications and documentation."
80,How will Apple's Vision Pro impact the extended reality sector?,"Technology Advancements: Apple's entry into the AR/VR hardware market could drive advancements in display technology, sensors, and processing power, making these technologies more accessible and compelling for consumers.
Market Growth: Apple's brand recognition and consumer base could accelerate the adoption of AR and VR technologies, leading to increased investment and innovation in the XR sector.
Ecosystem Development: Apple has a history of building robust ecosystems around its products and services. The release of ""Apple's Vision Pro"" could lead to the development of an extensive ecosystem of AR/VR apps, content, and accessories, further fueling the growth of the XR market.
User Experience: Apple's focus on user experience and design could lead to AR/VR devices that are more intuitive, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing, potentially attracting new users to the technology.
Content Creation: With Apple's support, content creators and developers may be more incentivized to create high-quality AR and VR experiences, leading to a richer and more diverse range of content available to users."
81,"Do you think Apple's Vision Pro can create the future like the iPhone, or come later but better like AirPods?","It will come later. Like AirPods. Or, more like the watch.
When the first Apple Watch came out it didn‚Äôt yet know who the product was aimed at. Apple does a lot of research about who ‚Äòmight‚Äô like their latest product. But they don‚Äôt always get it right. Today the focus is on Health monitoring and lots of people are liking their watches.
Vision Pro is intended as a new computer metaphor where there is no desktop. You wear it to enter a work mode you might usually have when you shut the door to your office and just focus on dealing with emails, project planning, media reviews, content creation, writing, and responding to people on your team. A lot of early adopters are really enjoying the movie environment and the 3D experiences, but Apple is downplaying the media consumption features and pushing the narrative of a totally new computer workspace.
I‚Äôm sure the Vision Pro will eventually have immersive game play and VR exclusive experiences. For now, the removal of a dedicated desk, lamp, mouse, and monitors is the main story. But that could change once the developer community releases a bunch of apps which make the device do much more. For solo experiences and singular media consumption it seems a trifle overkill to use a Vision Pro but when I think of how much some people spend on a TV set it doesn‚Äôt seem that much more expensive.
I am looking forward to seeing some interesting innovations for training and learning with the Vision Pro.
I also don‚Äôt agree with your view that the iPhone created the future. It just made the idea of a fixed use mobile phone obsolete and replaced it with a programmable device. I feel like the Vision Pro will replace the desktop with a programmable workplace."
82,Do you think the Apple Vision Pro will ultimately fail or not be as popular or widely used as Apple's other products?,"No. It will not fail. But it will not take the world by storm right away. It simply costs to much. $3000 is a lot to ask for.
But as far as I know and from my stand point, it is pretty awesome technology. I have trouble thinking this will be used much for gaming. I see this as a home entertainment center, and it will be hands down the best system available for movie consumption with amazing sound in your head.
If this is worth $3000 to you is something only you can answer. It isn‚Äôt for me. I do have a home cinema system which has probably cost me around $3000 but the whole family uses it, it contains a Playstation, Xbox and a bunch of Nintendo and other systems, Android, Plex, home theater and speakers and more.
In my case, it would require $12,000 to get the same feeling.
There will be cheaper models in the next few years, tech tends to cost a fortune at first, then drop in price.
It is not a new iPhone or iPad. But I think Apple will stick with it, it will be amazing tech and there are enough people in the world who don‚Äôt blink an eye for $3000, many people use $20,000 bags for lipstick and such and perhaps use it one time.
Still very cool stuff (not the bag)."

136,Have you experienced any memorable moments using the Apple Vision Pro's 3D photo and video capture feature?,"My virtual reality experiment: I was driving up a 6 lane superhighway early one August afternoon in clear bright sunlight at about 65 miles per hour in my clunky Toyota Corolla DX, with no other cars on the road. I decided to look intently at the little image in the car's rear view mirror -- no high tech apparatus. I really really really really intently focused all my attention on that little image! It was entirely convincing. That ""little"" image became my whole experienced reality: I was driving where I had been, not where the automobile was going. Fortunately I ""snapped out of it"" in time to avoid becoming a one car crash in the ditch on the right side of the road. (It was a very good place to have conducted this experiment, because there was a police barracks, a teaching hospital, and both Christian and Jewish cemeteries nearby, just in case.)
You may try to repeat my virtual reality experiment at your own risk; I strongly advise you against doing so. I assure you: It worked. (Of course it will not work if you don't ""give in to it"", just like a video game won't work if you just look at the pixels as what some computer programmer coded up with branching instructions depending on what inputs you enter.) Moral of this story: VIRTUAL REALITY CAN KILL YOU. Forewarned is forearmed."

139,Do you think Apple's Vision Pro will make 3D movies and TV shows more popular?,"My peculiar ocular history puts me in a good position to answer this. I had a weak right eye as a kid. My left eye was 20/60 and my right 20/200, but both correctable. I went through a lot of eye exercises to get my eyes to play nice together, but all I learned was how to select which eye I could look through. I can make a parallax shift without closing an eye. I do not have stereopsis. I can tell you that the lousy 5 cm separation between your eyes is trivial compared to the parallax clues you get from normal motion. I can catch a ball and thread needles. Lack of stereopsis has not had the slightest effect on my life, and I perceive the world as totally three dimensional.
In the last few years I had ocular implants to correct cataracts. So my eyes are pretty much equal. It has absolutely no impact on my life. I have gone to 3-D movies and, apart from a few instances where something comes right at my face, I see no difference.
I have no use whatsoever for 3-D gimmicks to put on my face and drain my wallet."

172,What is Apple Vision Pro and why are some users acting like jackasses?,"Apple Vision Pro is a AR headset (no matter how much Apple wants everyone to call it a ‚Äú spatial computing device‚Äù). Some people who use them are jackasses because a lot of people are jackasses, so anytime you have a random portion of the population use a thing a bunch will be jackasses. AR headsets, a specific car brand, blue shirts, pocket watches, plastic utensils.
People also get bored so they like news about new things, and ‚Äúsome jackass does something dumb with a thing you probably have not seen in person or gotten tired of hearing about‚Äù sells well, or attracts eyeballs to advertisements. So you get extra coverage of jackasses.
Also social media letting people share in advertising revenue on media they create means people are getting paid to be jackasses. So not only do we have the more traditional jackasses by incompetence, jackasses by accident, and jackasses by inclination, we now also get to enjoy professional (and aspiring professional) jackasses.
‚ÄúOh a new thing! What sort of stupidity can I commit with it that a lot of people will watch?‚Äù"
173,What is Unity's role in the development of Apple's Vision Pro headset?,"Unity is currently working with Apple to develop a chatbot for their Vision Pro headset. Unity - a game engine company - has implemented its facial recognition technology into the Vision Pro's camera.

198,Why is there much more enthusiasm around the Apple Vision Pro than around the Meta Quest 3? Is there really such a difference between them?,"Whoa. Hold on there, pardner.
The Quest 3 has plenty of enthusiasts and they‚Äôre still pretty impressed with it. It‚Äôs a great leap foreword in that category of devices. Immersive, powerful, and easy to wear. Surround sensors are much better than before. Visual rendering is much improved and will get even better in time. There are a bunch of apps you can download from the Quest Store and a couple of streaming services have apps made for the Quest. You can install an app which lets you connect to your PC or Mac. A lot of what is available is similar to Chrome apps or Web apps you might already have on your phone.
What I think you‚Äôre missing here is how the Vision Pro was not designed to be a VR headset. It runs lots of apps, already available on iPadOS, it connects to a Mac or MacBook and operates exactly the same way as the laptop or desktop, but with the apps running inside VisionOS. These will be apps you already own and use, not special apps made for Vision Pro. There are VPro apps and there will be more in due time, but being able to run and use most of the apps you already have is an interesting differentiator. Not everything people do on their MacBooks has (or needs) a Vision equivalent. Just connect to the Mac and continue as usual. The virtual workspaces you can select allow you to tune out as much of your outside distractions as you want, a little or a lot. If someone approaches you and needs your attention, the system detects them by automatically opening a portal in your field of view so you can see them. They can see a representation of your eyes, but it‚Äôs not quite as clear as you might want.
The Vision Pro is meant to do work as well as watch movies or TV. I understand you can see and use documents on a Quest headset, but it‚Äôs not clear how easy it is or what someone will experience while working on a document, or making a new one.
What is spectacularly different about the Vision Pro is the screen resolution and the eye tracking capabilities. You don‚Äôt have to hold any handles or click anything. Your eyes do the mousing, or selecting, and your fingers pinch, or move, to command the interface. The room you‚Äôre in is very well rendered and closely resembles the actual room as if watching through cameras and isn‚Äôt turning it into a cartoon equivalent. The ‚Äòscreens‚Äô you place around you stick in place and don‚Äôt wobble if you move. In fact you can leave the room and they are still there when you come back in.
Vision Pro is meant for staying in one place and doing all your stuff and is unlikely to be comfortable engaging in exercise routines or playing interactive games. It‚Äôs also completely secure, connects to iCloud over your WiFi, and can record stereo video and audio. It also connects to your Photos app and can play back stereo video recorded on your iPhone.
There‚Äôs a lot of talk about the video conferencing feature with FaceTime. It‚Äôs a nice first try, but I don‚Äôt imagine people would accept it right away. There‚Äôs lots of talk about which band is the best (I like Joan Armatrading) and it will depend on the shape of your head as well as your style of hair whether it‚Äôs going to fit comfortably. People have reported wearing the headset for 10 hours. Not that they were on battery all that time.
It‚Äôs a remarkable accomplishment so far. Now it needs developers to embrace desk-less computing and build the future for the rest of us."

201,How will the tech behind Apple's Vision Pro goggles be adapted for military use? How can it benefit the Ukranians on the front line right now?,"Augmented Reality technology has been under development (at least as far as the public knows) for military use as early as 2018 as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, or IVAS. This program was and still is under development by Microsoft based on AR technologies in their HoloLens 2 headsets, and is mainly aimed at creating a system that can project sensory information on top of a soldier‚Äôs field of view.
Disclaimer: Quora apparently has an AI image generator now. This is what it came up with. I don‚Äôt intend to use AI-generated images in my answers but figured I would include this one just as a heads-up to my readers. And I think its quite funny it also forgot to give the poor guy anything below the left elbow.
This is what IVAS actually looked like. It has been rolled out to select US Army units for initial testing and continued development.
IVAS is envisioned to vastly improve soldier‚Äôs situational awareness, target acquisition and engagement, and decision making. The system augments the soldier‚Äôs vision using thermals and night-vision devices, and includes radios that allow communication throughout a company. Initial versions of IVAS were met with a flurry of criticisms from congress and soldiers, citing numerous technical issues as well as its bulk and weight as serious impediments to the soldier‚Äôs effectiveness. Some soldiers even reported feeling sick, or that they felt even less-effective with the system.
In 2023, Microsoft and the US Army unveiled IVAS 1.2, and according to the Army at least this one is much closer to hitting the mark. Some technical issues persist, however it is reported to be far better than the 1.0 version. The bulky headset has been slimmed down by separating the controller and computers - the controller can go anywhere on the chest and the computer goes on the rear of the helmet. The display has been improved for greater clarity, and can now be flipped up like night-vision goggles.
What the future US Army soldier is shaping up to be?
Can they help in Ukraine?
Once IVAS is fully realised, this sort of technology could be a game-changer for the average infantryman. It integrates night-vision and thermal-vision. Renders of the goggle‚Äôs view (take with a grain of salt) depict an almost video-game like level of situational-awareness, with an overhead compass overlay and something like a mini-map in the corner. Users can open up maps in 3D, navigate the map and even drop markers on areas of interest.
This could be a massive help to Ukrainian infantry.
But, not in its current state. As it is, IVAS Version 1.2 is still yet to prove that it can do what it needs to do. Although development appears promising, we are yet to see results - especially after how poorly IVAS 1.0 seemed to have been received by troops. Augmented reality technology is starting to see increasing use in militaries around the world, but it doesn‚Äôt appear to be just ready for combat use just yet.

258,"If the Apple Vision Pro aims to replace the iPhone, doesn't it have to be portable and usable everywhere? How will people carry around the headset or show other people stuff without a screen?","I‚Äôm a retired educator and not involved in the tech industry. I‚Äôve been using/following Apple tech and tech in general since I first touched an Apple II in the early 1980s. My comments come from that perspective.
It seems to me that every time a new device is introduced there‚Äôs, wild speculation about how it will be used and what devices the new device will replace. The tech landscape is littered with devices that were supposed to be game changers and didn‚Äôt/haven‚Äôt quite lived up to expectations. Personally, I‚Äôd include VR glasses in that group. The jury is still out on what their impact will be and what they will replace.
I don‚Äôt think Apple intends for its VR system to be a complete replacement for most of its other devices. That‚Äôs not likely to happen for the foreseeable future‚Äîespecially as a replacement for the iPhone for the following reasons:
The price of the Vision Pro system is significantly more than even the most expensive iPhone models. People who are hesitant to spend roughly $1000 US on a new iPhone are certainly going to balk at the price of the Vision Pro system.
In their current form, I don‚Äôt see these glasses widely used in business/educational meetings. At least not to the extent that phones/tablets are until the majority of meeting participants have access to them. With my iPhone, I can simultaneously interact with people using a variety of devices/operating systems. That does not seem to be possible yet with this device.
From what I saw at the June WWDC event these glasses seem to be a bit bulky for long-term wear walking around a facility or walking to work."

Rather, ask how the United States of‚Ä¶Mexico shall survive the legacy of Alzheimer‚Äôs Biden and the endemic corruption which placed this near-brain-dead, dementia corpse into power, by the very breed of moral sewerage which inhabits the world of Apple, inc. & Silicon Valley."
317,"How do you think spatial computing, as introduced by the Apple Vision Pro, will revolutionize our interactions with technology in the future?","I don‚Äôt think it will catch fire.
In it‚Äôs current form it‚Äôs more of a gimmick in my mind.
Wearing Goggles for hours on end to play out real life scenes from a Sci Fi movie?
Have you ever heard the joke‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I just flew in from Las Vegas. Gee, are your arms tired?
Now, how long are you going to go Tony Stark‚Ä¶.. Reach out in front of you and use your computer before your arms get tired????????????"

319,Is Apple the only company on Earth that can pull off a product like their Apple Vision Pro? I'm not so sure Meta can match the feature set of AVP anytime soon?,"Yes, only Apple. No, not anytime soon.
Only Apple can provide developers with necessary software development kits to create next generation VR apps. See how windows drop shadows on tables? This means that cameras analyze the reality and present it as VR. Nobody else can do that and is unlikely to get the ability soon - Apple started on iPad with apps that placed offered products in your room. Nobody else had iPad‚Ä¶ Thus, nobody else has a legion of high quality apps to support their device at launch.
Only Apple has deeply integrated desktop and tablet OSes, so only Vision Pro can run its own apps, and iPad apps, and connect to Macs and allow to run its apps, all at once. Right now Vision Pro can be run for 8 hours and beet a four monitor physical setup with its virtual spacial computing. It will take years to play catch up with Apple.
Only Apple benefits from Vision Pro with other devices. Many Vision Pro apps can be run on iPad, many iPad apps can be run on a Mac. This allows Apple to be more confident when investing into Vision Pro.
Several quarters ago investors asked Apple why the profits were unreasonably huge. Tim answered that Apple was the only company present on screens of all sizes. This allowed Apple to pull off Vision Pro. When goggles replace screens, Apple will loose that advantage, but we already know that Apple will still be in the lead, just for other reasons."

Not counting fighter jets. Marketing and consumer engagement could come as a tourist uses a Vision Pro, walking down a street, and it can highlight successively each store and show information about each store, perhaps showcasing specials, or a menu for a restaurant. Far better experience than beacons in a store and the usual signage most stores use. Considering the price of one of these, the user would have to be on the wealthy side and thus a more lucrative customer. Can you imagine such a user passing by a car dealership or even one of those cars parked in the mall? How you could grab their attention with a virtual experience of the car? And give directions to the dealership and make a call or send a text to arrange a test drive? It could be a game changer for everyone, marketing as well as users. Obviously both are partners in any marketing and transaction."

I think there is a limit on how far away you can place something, I just don‚Äôt know if that limit is higher then the limit of how many times I can be bothered to grab the drag bar and push it away from myself or not.
In other words I doubt I can be bothered to put it more then 50 feet away, but if I could be bothered to do so the real limit might be roughly what you can make a IEEE 64 bit float represent (around 4000 million) in whatever the units actually are, maybe inches or millimeters. Which is a considerable distance. Far enough that if you really wanted to do it, you might get the best effect by driving to where you want it, placing it, and driving back to where you can‚Äôt see it anymore because it is too small.
On the other hand, sure you can put it anywhere to the left, right, above, below, or behind you. Basically wherever you can be bothered to drag or shove it. Plus you can move yourself and place it and then move yourself again and the windows stays where it was, it doesn‚Äôt follow you.
Sometimes I will place a window while using the laser cutter (in the basement) and later while in my office in the second floor I‚Äôll want that window back‚Ä¶fortunately visionOS doesn‚Äôt try to make the floors and ceilings and such occlude windows so I can look down and grab it from the basement and it pulls quite quickly through the two floors and into the room I am in."

The device may be part of a niche market that has already peaked and lost its momentum."
342,"What do you think of Zuckerberg's words about Apple's Vision Pro ""has no magic fix that we haven't already thought of""?","Mark Zuckerberg sent out a company wide email[1] where he mentioned this:
From what I‚Äôve seen initially, I‚Äôd say the good news is that there‚Äôs no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws of physics that our teams haven‚Äôt already explored and thought of
He also mentioned that Apple took some trade off decisions like a high resolution and high computing that it requires external battery with a wire attached to use it and it might make sense for the cases they‚Äôre going for.
There is a fundamental difference between their approaches which I also felt while watching WWDC event. Apple wants the device to be more personal which can ultimately replace cell phone from your lives. This would require the device to be very powerful. At the same time, it should not obstruct normal human communication while you are wearing the headset.
This is the reason they made the screen transparent so that your eyes are visible, blended it with your environment so that you can see what is around and show others if you can see them or not[2].
On the other hand Mark‚Äôs vision of metaverse is social. For this devices need to be very affordable. Instead of having a solo experience, you can dive into a new world with others around. Its about interacting in new ways and feeling closer in new ways.
I think a perfect device would be that provides both the capabilities and no doubt we will see such devices in the coming decade. That would have a much lighter frame and could also act as a replacement for spectacles. Something, like we have seen in Jonny Quest.
At the moment, I think Apple has a competitive edge over Facebook. Apple also has years of experience in designing best human device interfaces like mouse, click wheel and multitouch screen. This also does not mean Facebook will lose the competition. They have a great head start in this direction and if they can figure out ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù and ‚Äúaffordability‚Äù together in next few years they will be selling such devices in huge numbers.

Apple know how to market.
I think the third one is going to be a big deal. Something Apple gets is how to make sure people seen with their devices early on aren‚Äôt nerdy arseholes. I used to see people with Google Glasses around the Bay Area. The first time I saw Google Glasses, they were being worn by the sort of tosspot who is convinced writing software is cool. You know the sort, long hair, t-shirt with some ‚Äúhilarious‚Äù Linux commands on it. And he was at an art exhibition at the deYoung Museum, looking at Johannes Vermeer‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirl With A Pearl Earring‚Äù. Why this arsehole thought he needed to augment one of the finest paintings ever created is beyond me.
But either way, he looked like an arsehole.
Every single person I saw wearing Google Glass looked the same. And the takeaway for me was ‚Äúunder no circumstances am I going to wear one of those‚Äù.
Apple get that. When they launched Watch, they made sure to get it in the hands of well know celebrities. Tesla, actually understand this as well. When they launched the Tesla Roadster, they had George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio in them. Google would have made sure Bill Gates was seen in it.
Apple will get Vision Pro in the hands of normal, non-nerdy people.

Moreover, if you're looking purely at cost-effectiveness when purchasing a laptop then investing in an Apple device may not be the best choice. With a higher price point, it may take longer to see a return on your investment compared to other more affordable options in the market.
Ultimately, whether the Apple Vision Pro is worth the investment depends on individual preferences and needs. If you value top-of-the-line performance and are willing to pay a premium for it, then this laptop is worth considering.

- Negative Aspects
Negative Aspects
While the Apple Vision Pro has received praise for its performance and features, some negative aspects have been mentioned by customers.

In India, where affordability is a major concern for consumers, the starting price of Rs. 1,50,000 can be a deterrent for many potential buyers. While this price may be justified by the advanced technology and premium design of the device, it still puts it out of reach for a large segment of the market.
2. Limited availability - Another issue faced by Indian customers is limited availability.

429,What are some possible drawbacks to the high price tag of the Apple Vision Pro headset for up-and-coming artists and their fans?,"There could be some potential drawbacks for up-and-coming artists and their fans. Here are a few possible considerations:
1. Accessibility and Affordability: High-priced headsets could limit accessibility to the technology for both artists and fans. Up-and-coming artists may struggle to afford the headsets themselves, hindering their ability to fully engage with the technology or create immersive experiences for their fans. On the other hand, fans who are interested in experiencing concerts through the headset may find it challenging to afford the device, limiting their ability to engage with their favorite artists in this new way.
2. Audience Reach: If the Apple Vision Pro headset is expensive, it might result in a smaller audience reach for up-and-coming artists. Fans who cannot afford the headset may be excluded from the virtual concert experience, potentially diminishing the artist's ability to connect with a broader audience or gain new fans.
3. Financial Viability for Artists: High-priced headsets could impact the financial viability of virtual concerts for up-and-coming artists. If a significant portion of their fan base cannot afford the headset, it may limit the potential revenue generated from virtual concert experiences. This could pose challenges for artists who rely on concert income to support their careers and invest in future projects.
4. Dependency on Third-Party Platforms: If the Apple Vision Pro headset is the primary or exclusive platform for these immersive concert experiences, artists may become dependent on the policies, licensing agreements, and revenue-sharing models established by Apple or any other platform provider. This could impact artists' ability to have control over their content, pricing, or distribution, potentially leading to limitations or conflicts in the long run.
5. Technology Fragmentation: If the Apple Vision Pro headset is not widely adopted due to its high price, it may lead to fragmentation in the VR/AR concert industry. Different manufacturers may develop their own competing headsets or platforms, each with its own ecosystem and audience base. This fragmentation could make it more challenging for up-and-coming artists to reach their fans consistently across various platforms, resulting in a more fragmented and potentially less cohesive virtual concert experience."
430,What are the advantages of using Apple's Vision Pro for professionals in various industries?,"With Apple Vision Pro, you have an infinite canvas that transforms how you use the apps you love. Arrange apps anywhere and scale them to the perfect size, making the workspace of your dreams a reality ‚Äî all while staying present in the world around you."
431,How often does Apple update Vision Pro?,"Well. Given that they have just released the first one, the answer is never.
In actuality, it is likely that they will update the OS every year in line with iPadOS (on which VisionOS is currently based). and it is likely that they will have sporadic hardware updates, or new models being released in the first few years, and then they will settle down to a yearly cycle."
432,If you are over 50 and becoming long-sighted are the Apple Vision Pro and other VR headsets completely out of the question? Or can you wear glasses while using them? How does that affect the user experience?,"If you are long-sighted, then you have a prescription for eye-glasses. You can‚Äôt wear them and the Apple Vision Pro, so you arrange for getting the Zeiss (magnetic) optical inserts with your prescription for $150."
433,Would the Apple Vision Pro be a good tool for remote job interviews in which explaining 3D models and parts or environments are necessary? Would the advantage of shared viewing of a 3D model improve the 2nd level assessment experience?,"In the short term, no. There are a couple of serious obstacles
price: it‚Äôs $3,500, and most people don‚Äôt have one. A company would have to ship this very expensive device to someone and get it back. Theft and damage in shipping would cost a lot of money
software: having a piece of software that lets you accurately place exactly the right object you want, exactly where you want them, in a 3D scene, streamed over the internet so someone else can see, is massively complicated. And don‚Äôt forget that candidates likely have no experience with the specific interview software being used, so that software would also have to be very quickly learned - we‚Äôre talking in the opening minutes of an interview
lack of utility: the main challenges in hiring are finding good candidates, retaining their interest, making accurate job posts, and getting the compensation right. Increasing the hiring signal is nice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly important
If the price comes way down, and most people get one, and the software gets better, and there are specific application for interviews that can‚Äôt be replicated in 2D (like a top-down view of a model, or moving a virtual camera around in a 3D environment) then I‚Äôll believe it."

Apple's commitment to design and user experience could potentially result in a more streamlined and polished experience compared to traditional gaming platforms.
Ultimately, the success and impact of the Vision Pro headset would depend on its actual features, performance, and software ecosystem, which are yet to be announced."
448,How did the release of Vision Pro affect Apple's stock price?,The market was disapointed there wasn‚Äôt more or that it won‚Äôt be availible quicker. But then it started going up again.
449,What streaming apps are available on Apple's new Vision Pro headset?,"The current lineup of streaming apps for Vision Pro includes Disney+, ESPN+, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, TikTok, NBA, MLB and PGA Tour."
450,What is Apple's strategy with their Vision Pro headset?,"As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Apple has not officially released or announced the Apple Vision Pro headset. Therefore, specific details about Apple's strategy for this hypothetical product are not available.
However, based on Apple's track record and approach with their other products, we can speculate on some possible strategies that Apple might consider for a new headset like the Vision Pro:
Integration with Apple Ecosystem: Apple has a history of creating products that seamlessly integrate with their existing ecosystem of devices and services.

454,"If Steve Jobs was alive, how would he critique Apple's latest vision pro?","That‚Äôs rather hard to guess. Probably like the game changing idea, the ease of use. Probably wish it were cheaper so more people can afford to adopt using it and thus more companies will create killer applications for it. As this is a Vision Pro, there will likely be a more affordable version coming out next. Apple was all about the computer for the rest of us, so this is a first facial computer, I imagine he would want to introduce a smaller cheaper model for kids. Got to get the kids involved, as they learn so much better before they become adult, and there could be so much 3D classwork to create. Far cheaper than bussing kids to museums. The museums come to you. Travel the world and speak to new people without leaving your chair. He would definitely like the idea. They all look the same when off, so some kind of customization to tell one from the next, perhaps a name tag on the back or color versions of the headband. Always good for making a few extra dollars in customization not unlike various watch bands for the Apple Watch."
455,"What are your thoughts on Apple filing 5,000 patents to make their Vision Pro headset a reality?","I'd guess that about 99% of the patents will be worthless, and many of them will never make it. They said 'filed', not 'issued', so I'm guessing most won't make it out of provisional. I can't blame Apple for working to protect every conceivable corner of this device because of the constant IP litigation they face from patent trolls who seem to show up with wild claims about the extent of their prior art.
They are doing the prudent thing, but don't hold your breath; it will likely not amount to much. Apple will be far better off letting competition enter the category in some form. If litigation comes their way, they can probably counter with something. I saw that statement as a warning shot more than anything.
It's difficult to innovate with so many trolls waiting in the wings. It's hard for any company to create a truly new breakthrough device these days."
456,What tiny company supplies Apple for the new Vision Pro?,"Kioxia makes the NAND chips they use. Formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corp. and founded 5 years ago. Not a tiny company with 15,300 employees. Certainly not Texas Instruments with 31,000 employees. ON semiconductor has 33,000 employees. Analog Devices 24,450 is in-between. USI Global is a bit off the smallest with 23,300 employees. Lattice Semiconductor is a good choice. Only 949 employees. Still worth $487 million dollars. They make the low power Field Programmable Gate Array chip."
457,What compromises will Apple make to create a more affordable version of its Vision Pro headset?,"They‚Äôre counting on economies of scale, not ‚Äòcompromises.‚Äô That first model will also recoup a chunk of the R&D expenses.
My guess is this ‚ÄòPro‚Äô will essentially be the ‚Äòbase‚Äô model whenever the refresh happens; there will be a new ‚ÄòPro.‚Äô There could be some bundle or materials changed, but I don‚Äôt think they will be hopping Vision features."
458,"Why did Apple avoid using the term ""artificial intelligence"" during the launch of Vision Pro?","Psychological defense mechanisms refer to the psychological strategies or behavioral patterns that individuals consciously or unconsciously adopt when faced with psychological stressors, such as threats, anxieties, or conflicts, in order to protect their psychological equilibrium and self-esteem. These mechanisms help individuals alleviate negative emotions, reduce anxiety, or protect their self-image and self-concept.
For example, here are some common defense mechanisms:
Denial: Refusing to acknowledge or accept reality or denying the truth to avoid unpleasant situations.
Repression: Unconsciously excluding unpleasant or conflicting thoughts, emotions, or memories from awareness, rendering them inaccessible.
It seems like Apple's avoidance of the term ""artificial intelligence"" during the launch of Vision Pro is a sign that they're putting up some defense mechanisms. This actually tells us two things: Internally, they're aware that there's an issue with their strategy, but they're not willing to confront or acknowledge it. Apple no longer has product managers who truly have the authority to speak up, and their product decisions are now being influenced by ""politicians""."
459,"What‚Äôs the most affordable way to develop for the Apple Vision Pro, with the ability to have some actual headset to do real testing, as Xcode emulation only goes so far?","An attempt at an answer but would love to hear from someone with closer subject matter experience.

The Quest Pro comes with a pair of physical motion controllers and a charging dock for the headset and controllers alike. Meanwhile, the Apple Vision Pro does not rely on controllers, instead reading finger and hand movements via the cameras and sensors. It will support Bluetooth gamepads for video games, though."
469,How does the design of the Vision Pro compare to Apple's other products?,"About the same. I haven't taken one apart but, found unnecessary parts in all the iPhones. Steve Jbs would have been disappointed. The Apple stores need updating. VP is ug. How are you suppose to clean the thing."
470,Why did Apple choose a 90Hz refresh rate for their Vision Pro headset?,"Apple may have chosen a 90Hz refresh rate for their Vision Pro headset for a number of reasons.
* Smoother movement A display with a higher refresh rate is updated more frequently, resulting in smoother motion and a more immersive experience. This is especially crucial for virtual reality (VR) headsets, which immerse users in a virtual world.
There was less motion sickness. Using VR headsets can cause motion sickness in some people, but a faster refresh rate can help reduce this. This is due to the fact that the smoother motion is less likely to cause nausea and confusion in the user's brain.
* **Decreased latency.** Latency, or the amount of time it takes for the user's actions to appear on the screen, is also reduced by a faster refresh rate. This is crucial for games and other applications that require quick responses.
Even though a refresh rate of 120 Hz would be even smoother, it would also take more power and drain the battery faster. It's possible that Apple decided that a refresh rate of 90 Hz was a good way to balance smoothness and power consumption.
The Vision Pro headset supports HDR, which allows for a wider range of colors and a more realistic viewing experience in addition to the refresh rate. Additionally, there are two 1080p displays in the headset, each with a resolution of 2048 x 2048 pixels. A high-resolution image like this is necessary for an immersive virtual reality experience.
The Vision Pro headset appears to be an effective and versatile VR headset overall. A smooth and immersive VR experience should be made possible by high-resolution displays, HDR support, and the 90Hz refresh rate."

476,How will Apple scaling back Vision Pro headset production affect its stock?,"Apple scaling back production of its rumored VR/AR headset, reportedly called Vision or Vision Pro, is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on Apple's stock in the near term for several reasons:
The headset has not been officially announced yet. Many details and rumors about the product are still speculative at this point. It has not factored into Apple's current earnings guidance or analyst estimates.
Any impact would likely be minimal given Apple's immense size and diversified product portfolio. The headset is expected to be a niche product at launch, at least initially.
Apple's stock performance is driven much more by sales of the iPhone, which still accounts for over 50% of revenue. Headset sales would represent a tiny fraction of Apple's overall business for the foreseeable future.
Reports indicate Apple is just slowing initial production as it refines the design and software of the headset. This is a normal part of product development and does not necessarily mean the project is in trouble.
Investors and analysts tend to focus more on Apple's short-term iPhone sales and services growth, rather than longer-term potential from new products like VR or AR headsets. This type of news typically does not move the stock significantly.
Apple still plans to launch the headset eventually, likely in 2023. As long as the product launch stays on the expected time frame and meets Apple's high standards for design and user experience, it should be well received by the market over the long term.
So in summary, while reports of Apple slowing production of its rumored VR headset are an interesting data point, the news is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on Apple's stock in the near future given the product's nascent stage, small initial impact, and Apple investors' current focus on smartphone and services performance. Over the longer term, a successful headset launch could boost sentiment, but that is still likely a year or more away."
477,Do you think that Apple's extended coverage for the Vision Pro headset is required?,"Whether or not the extended coverage is required depends on your personal preference and usage of the device. If you are someone who uses the Vision Pro headset frequently and are concerned about accidental damage, then the extended coverage may be worth considering. However, if you are someone who uses the device infrequently and is generally careful with your electronics, then the standard one-year warranty and 90 days of technical support that come with the device may be sufficient"
478,What are the production challenges that Apple is facing with its Vision Pro headset?,"The biggest challenge with the Vision Pro is it‚Äôs a generation 1 product that is starting off as a very high end model, so all of these units will be 100% man assembled. The tolerances and fit and finish will be subjected to extreme levels of scrutiny from the QA department in Pegatron.
From the reports from apple a few months ago, nearly 80% of the early units were not good enough for Appel, so that alone is very eye opening on the assembly. One can imagine it must be extremely difficult for a worker to fold the many tiny cables and boards inside the headset without scratching the housing, or cracking the front formed piece of glass."
479,When will fans be able to purchase Apple's new Vision Pro headset?,"Early next year in 2024, staring with US first. Other countries will follow soon after but dates are not yet revealed."

483,How do you think Apple should address the ergonomic issues of the Vision Pro headset?,"What is the most common injury in VR?
‚ÄúAs with any physical activity, there is a risk of injury, and because the devices are primarily used within a confined space indoors, there are additional hazards that may endanger VR users.‚Äù Broken bones were the most common reported injury, followed by cuts, contusions and sprains.Dec 28, 2023
Just like Lawn Darts. Dangerous toys / technology needs to be looked at.
VR is a niche market and people are breaking their televisions ‚Äú Accidentally ‚Äú injuring themselves, falling down, breaking bones, going to hospitals.
If everyone owned one there would be 100,000‚Äôs of injuries. It‚Äôs interesting Dangerous tec.
Someone will die of a head injury one day. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.
Like the old song goes, be the first one on your block to have your son come home in a box."
484,"What apps, content, and ecosystem does Apple need to provide to make the Vision Pro more attractive?",Everything they showed off is plenty for that purpose. There is no need to do anything further as I guarantee it will sell out quickly.
485,What monthly financing plans does Apple offer for the Vision Pro virtual reality headset?,"I do not work for Apple or any stores selling the headset named above, but a Google search answered: $291.58/mo. for 12 months. I assume that‚Äôs in US dollars (but I could be wrong).
Another search spoke of a plan for those with an Apple credit card, which I do not own and cannot speak regarding that plan (or even the math which provided those amounts above).
FWIW, CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer was quoted saying that the company ""priced it at the right level considering the value of it."" I‚Äôve not considered the product."
486,What are some potential reasons why Apple didn't opt for a USB-C connector for the Vision Pro battery pack?,"Q: What are some potential reasons why Apple didn't opt for a USB-C connector for the Vision Pro battery pack?

That is wrong, it actually is USB-C"
487,"What do you think is the reason behind Apple pricing Vision Pro at $3,499?","A huge amount of money went into research and development. They need to recuperate their R&D costs. Thry had to figure out how many units and what price point to sell them at, to break even."
488,Which companies did Apple partner with for the launch of Vision Pro?,"Apple said that they worked together with Zeiss to create special detachable lenses for people wearing glasses.
Other then that I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶"
489,Why does Apple only allow one person in a household to fully use the Vision Pro?,"Because it is the easiest thing to do.
It is based on iOS and iOS‚Äôs security model is ‚Äúone trusted user‚Äù, so it isn‚Äôt all that great at having multiple key bags, multiple sets of installed data, and multiple sets of apps.
I mean iOS is also based on the same underpinnings as macOS and it does support most of those things (the multiple key bag support is janky though because that was an iOS concept dragged up to the mac after it proved to be super useful). So you could add those things back in if it is worth the effort. Keep in mind things like ‚Äúoh gosh, you can‚Äôt install that new app or upgrade this old one because you are out of storage‚Ä¶‚Äù might require getting one of the other users to fix it because they have a bunch of stuff installed that needs to be uninstalled so you have enough room for things. iOS doesn‚Äôt even have a user visible concept of where applications are installed, so developing a concept of ‚Äúthis app is installed for all users‚Äù would be a little odd. If two users install Netflix should they share the one app, or do they each get their own? If they share it, what if one person upgrades it and another doesn‚Äôt? Do they share downloaded videos or does the one app install ‚Äúact like‚Äù two independent installs?
All solvable problems, but each of them will take some time to figure out what a good solution actually is, maybe some more time to implement it, and in some cases some time to ‚Äúsit with it‚Äù and decide if ti was the right choice, especially in light of all the other involved choices.
It could be done, but would probably require a modest sized team to do it, and for many other teams to do some work of their own, and then probably some 3rd party support. It would be a big tent pole sized feature, and you really only get a few of them a year. Or per product. So let's say you had been on the Vision Pro program management team in 2022. You are gearing up for a late 2023 release. You want multiple user support, it is the thing you think will make a $3500 product viable in a household. What other major vision pro feature do you push out to 2.0 to make room for ‚Äúmulti user support‚Äù? Do you get rid of the iPad app compatibility? Or maybe the vision version of Safari? Or the immersive environments (they are a huge deal when using, I‚Äôm not sure if they were a huge effort, so you might not even get enough people-bandwidth shook loose by knocking that down a peg)? Hand tracking? The immersive videos? What do you sacrifice to get multi-user?
Tough call, isn‚Äôt it?
My personal choice would be ‚Äúok full user switching is too big a feature, let's do a sort of iPad school style account swapping via iCloud user swap feature. It may take a few minutes to swap user accounts, but we can make it low effort for the users and maybe do it with a team of five and some substantial support from the security team, but the other cross functional impact will be low, everyone else is just doing what it would take for backups to work‚Ä¶‚Äù
From a technical level it kind of sucks because it dodges all the interesting hard issues. From a user perspective it kind of sucks because it will take minutes to swap over (making sure a full backup is completed and confirmed, then doing a full restore‚Ä¶maybe five minutes with decent network connectivity, longer for slow networks, maybe a bit less time if the headset does the full save when you take it off and some time passes before ether next person picks it up because I would make sure we push out a save each time we are left idle). Still it might manage to be less a major tent pole‚Äôs worth of effort and be something you can do with a small team and still make a reasonable impact.
It would even arguably bump sales because it can be on ‚Äúextended loan‚Äù to someone else in the family. Like it is a pain enough to use the current guest mode where you need to do a full setup each time you take it off your head and put it on again (and ‚Äúoff your head‚Äù can include ‚Äúpushed up enough to rub your eyes‚Äù not ‚Äúentirely off your head‚Äù!), so it is unlikely for a ‚Äúguest‚Äù to watch a whole 3D feature length film for example. So if that is what would have convinced them, you aren‚Äôt getting it. With the ability to use it for multiple sessions I can see spouses who wouldn‚Äôt pay $3500 for a ‚Äúgiant TV only one of them can use‚Äù to get one to share (so +1 sale), and then deciding it is so awesome that they will squeeze the budget and get a second one for the other spouse (+2 sales total). Although that would only be for families that have $7k disposable income, or at least bugetable for something that is probably only an entertainment device type income. That isn‚Äôt a lot of families.
The real problem is I cheated. I told you to pick a launch feature to get rid of in favor of ‚Äúreal multiuser‚Äù, and then I went ahead and didn‚Äôt pick one. So if I had to I would have picked the personaes. The uncanny valley 3D avatars. Problem is while I can say ‚Äúthey are creepy and disturbing at worst, and just kind of like a 3D video game version of myself that works better in a professional context then the already available animated emoji cartoon alien and dinosaurs and stuff, um, they are not exactly a roaring success‚Äù I‚Äôm also looking at the launched version. Two years ago whoever was making the choices likely assumed they would be less creepy, and therefore way more valuable. Long term they may even get out of the uncanny valley and become valuable.
You would need them to sit in a 3D space with your significant other watching a movie together while you are both actually wearing the headsets (and maybe not in the same physical space).
So if you and another PM were both trying to defend your feature choices I can see why the senior executives would pick the creepy avatars over real multi-user‚Ä¶and I really can‚Äôt see any of the other launch features as less valuable.
(I might also be cheating by saying ‚Äúvision native notes app‚Äù is too small a feature to trade away, like I assume the notes app was less a major effort, and more a proof of concept of having a working platform API for various apps, and things like notes and mail were pretty minor deals in terms of time, and things like immersive photos that actually use new capabilities are the major efforts, and Safari gets to be a major effort because it has the larger amount of platform specific UX and UI changes‚Ä¶I would definitely trade away vision native notes apps, or the mail app!)"

491,"If you were Apple CEO Tim Cook, what response would you come up to counter the critics of the Vision Pro?","I would counter it by releasing something the public actually wants: A job that pays a living wage. A way for cashiers to open more registers with the lines get long. A way for military veterans to get healthcare that doesn‚Äôt involve waiting three months to get an appointment. A government that tells the truth. A government that doesn‚Äôt drop bombs on poor people in third world countries. A school system that actually teaches children reading, math, and science.
A court system that doesn‚Äôt victimize victims but fails to punish perpetrators. A judicial system that works the same for rich and poor alike instead of this two-tier fraud we have now. A prison system that isn‚Äôt a learning institution for criminality. An airport that doesn‚Äôt make people feel like worthless cargo. Airlines that don‚Äôt treat humans like cattle.
