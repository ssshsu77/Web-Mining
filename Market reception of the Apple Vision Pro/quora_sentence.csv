"The Vision Pro is unlike pretty much any other AR / VR headset, in that it doesn't require any extra hardware for you to control it.",experience
It's decked out with a multitude of cameras and sensors for eye-tracking and hand-tracking and it works remarkably well.,experience
"To move your (mouse) pointer, you just look at the app or virtual button you want to press, and then tap your pointer finger and thumb together (either hand works); this acts as a click.",experience
"To scroll, simply hold those same fingers together and pull up or down, left or right.",experience
"It takes a bit of practice, but after a few minutes, it's pretty intuitive.",experience
"Honestly, it's pretty incredible.",experience
"The other neat thing is, it doesn't really matter where your hands are placed.",experience
"You can have them out in front of you or resting at your side, and the device will still detect your movements.",experience
The cameras in the Vision Pro can do a remarkably good job at picking up your clicks and scrolls without making you work that hard.,experience
It feels natural and relaxed.,experience
So basically it is a great product from Apple,general
"but looking at the price, it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea",price
"Right now, Apple is in a weak marketing position because there are no new features for the iPhone 15 series except for the change to USB-C connectors.",general
It looks like Apple is putting more marketing weight behind Apple Watch than the iPhone.,general
"Like any other Apple product, Vision Pro comes with a hefty price.",price
This tech won't become widely adopted until either a) it becomes far more fashionable / practical or b) the utility of the device is so compelling itÄôs appearance just doesn't matter.,general
