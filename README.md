This assignment involves writing functions to analyze the word distributions and key concepts within an article. You will utilize Python and specific packages such as `numpy` and `string` to facilitate this analysis. Essential programming constructs like strings, lists, and dictionaries will be used extensively with operations such as `split`, `join`, `count`, `index`, and `strip` to manipulate and process the text data. Additionally, you will employ `numpy` functions including `sum`, `where`, `log`, `argsort`, `argmin`, and `argmax` to perform numerical operations that support the analysis of the article's content. This README file outlines the required libraries and key functions, ensuring you have the necessary tools and knowledge to successfully complete the assignment.
